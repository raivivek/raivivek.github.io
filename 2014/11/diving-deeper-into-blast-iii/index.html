and does it job in a pretty decent way. However, anyone who has worked
with it for some time with some non trivial details has their own
horror stories to tell. For the past few months where I have been
engaged in development of
<a href=https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenceserver>SequenceServer</a>, we got
a lot of opportunities to see the ugly inconsistencies buried within an
otherwise beautiful program.</p><p>BLAST+ is the newer and improved version of legacy BLAST executables
with improved performance and new features. It goes through close
to two cycles of release every year and includes performance patches or fixes
introduced against community bug reports.</p><p>I will talk in brief about few problems that we encountered while
developing SequenceServer.</p><h3 id=whats-up-with-the-xml-format>What&rsquo;s up with the XML format?&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#whats-up-with-the-xml-format></a></h3><p>One of my major tasks with SequenceServer was to create a data layer which will
be helpful in creating flexible graphical interface. This required me to run
BLAST and obtain the results in XML format, and parse and store it accordingly.</p><p>One of the curious things to notice in the XML file is the presence
of <code>&lt;Iteration_stat></code> tag within each query. Although if you compare
the values in the tag across all queries,you will find that they are all the
same. Indeed, the data contained in <code>&lt;Iteration_stat></code> appears to represent
statistical metrics related to the entire user query and not every query.
queries are same, and indeed they represent statistical information
based on the entire query and not per query. You can examine one
sample XML file
<a href=https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenceserver/blob/master/spec/ss_sample_blast_with_hits.xml>here</a>.</p><p>This to me suggests an erroneous schema design for the XML output.</p><h3 id=problematic-start-and-end-coordinates>Problematic start and end coordinates&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#problematic-start-and-end-coordinates></a></h3><p>If you examined the XML file, you can notice that the sequence
alignments, start, and end co-ordinates are all provided very
nicely. When using the HTML format output option (provided with all
BLAST programs) like prior versions of SequenceServer, we receive a well
formatted output where longer sequences are properly broken on
multiple lines along with start and end coordinates for the same.
But as we were generating the HTML ourselves, we had to manually
calculate the start and stop ends for each line.</p><p>In general, the start and end coordinates are agnostic of the
reading frame and one has to properly infer them from the <code>qframe</code>
and <code>hframe</code> values. In other words, you need to see whether you are
moving on the positive strand or the negative stand. However,
<code>blastn</code> makes an exception to this rule and automatically makes
this informed decision. I don't know if that should be the scenario
but whatever be the case, it certainly is not consistent. This had
to be taken in care of separately in the commit shown below.</p><div class="highlight ruby"><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span class=line><span class=cl>index def28ff..cb236fa 100644

<a href=https://github.com/wwood>@wwood</a>, we found that FASTA ids with only
numbers in it didn&rsquo;t play very well with <code>blastdbcmd</code>, the command we use to
format FASTA files and create BLAST+ compatible databases.</p><p>The bug, since then, went on without activity until recently when we
tried to fix it using a simple hack. As hits can also be queried
using accession number and not only ids, we simply started using
accession number with a <code>lcl|</code> added to the start. This not only
preserved the previous desired behavior but also solved the
problem of error with numeric ids

<span class=sidenote><a href=https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenceserver/commit/6d83a0833c42ec3a9e944ebc7873603f4a82d774>SHA: 6d83a0833c42ec3a9e9</a></span>
</span>.</p><p>However, with the release of BLAST+ 2.2.30<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> we noticed that
our hack didn&rsquo;t play well with the <code>-target-only</code> option of <code>blastdbcmd</code>.
Since, our implementation moves according to the latest version of BLAST+, we
had to revert the commit.</p><p>As of now, the issue is still open and we wait for it to be fixed upstream.
Apparently, the BLAST+ team is aware of the issue but it seems to be poorly
documented. Here is what they had to say when I reached out to them with the
issue:</p><blockquote cite><p><pre><code>... but when lcl|integer is used (either directly on the definition line, or when
only an integer is used), the programs assume that the integer is a gi
number. We will investigate the feasibility of applying a check.
</code></pre></p><footer></footer></blockquote><h3 id=continued-issues-with-funky-ids>Continued issues with funky ids&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#continued-issues-with-funky-ids></a></h3><p>Another weird issue popped us when we were playing around with some
funky ids. These ids contained some symbols and weird characters
like hashes and pipes. I&rsquo;m not yet sure if this is an undesired
behavior but it is certainly absurd. Here is a small demo:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span class=line><span class=cl>$ cat funky_ids.fa
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>&gt;abc|def

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>abc:def
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>abcdef#
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>abc#def
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you noticed the first line of both commands you can see that the pipe
character in first case is being weirdly displayed as a colon. As I
said, I don&rsquo;t know yet if it is a desired or intentional behavior but
whatever it is, it sure needs some explanation or documentation. I have
already emailed the BLAST+ team about this and expecting their reply
anytime soon.</p><p>I will have some more updates with my recent adventures with <a href=https://github.com/yeban/afra>Afra (an
annotation editor)</a> in coming week.</p><p>Stay tuned!</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Retrieving blast sequences doesn&rsquo;t work well with numbers #88, <a href=https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenceserver/issues/88>SequenceServer, GitHub</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>NCBI BLAST+ Release Notes, October 2nd, 2014.
