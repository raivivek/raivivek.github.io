<a href=/code/understanding-blast-output>previous post</a>
where I was trying to parse the BLAST+ XML output to create an efficient data
layer in SequenceServer. A critical and often demanded feature for the
application was the ability to have a graphical overview of all the obtained
hits. NCBI&rsquo;s BLAST portal, for instance, includes a graphical overview of
your results that summarizes how many hits you got and how do they score.

<input type=checkbox id=marginnote-0 class=margin-toggle>
<span class=marginnote><img src=/images/ncbi.png>

</span>However, we had nothing for SequenceServer.</p><p>The feature request had been sitting on project&rsquo;s urgent list for quite a long time and
couldn&rsquo;t be delayed any longer. So, after having a discussion with project
maintainer Anurag, I assigned this task to myself.</p><h2 id=approaches>Approaches&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#approaches></a></h2><p>There were a couple of options for solving this problem. Initially, we
considered using <a href=http://chmille4.github.io/Scribl/>Scribl</a>, an HTML5
canvas based library written specifically for drawing genomic regions,
alignments, assembly data and so on. However, the features and
flexibility that we were looking for weren&rsquo;t available or not easy to
integrate with our backend.
<label for=marginnote-1 class=margin-toggle>⊕</label>
<input type=checkbox id=marginnote-1 class=margin-toggle>
<span class=marginnote><img src=/images/d3.png></span></p><p>The second obvious choice was the use of <a href=http://d3js.org>d3.js</a>
Javascript library, a powerful data-driven visualization generator.
It&rsquo;s fairly low level and allows a large degree of custom control and
manipulation over components, thereby allowing users to create rich,
high quality graphics rendered in
<a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/SVG>SVG</a>. The library can be
easily powered by the data obtained directly from the backend layer.
However, a more elegant choice was to remove this dependency on the
backend and disperse all the necessary information inside the page
itself using the HTML5 data attributes. These data-attributes would then
be highly useful, not only for obtaining data but also for applying
custom styling and dynamic behavior using JS. For example, you could
just do</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span class=line><span class=cl>// This iterates over all elements with the mentioned data-attrib
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>// See public/js/jquery.graphit.js
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>$(&#34;[data-graphit=&#39;overview&#39;]&#34;).each(function(i) {
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>    // Do stuff here
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>});
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id=implementation>Implementation&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#implementation></a></h2><p>After the basic idea was conceived, I started playing around a little
with d3 and found it quite interesting. Anurag then showed me the BLAST
interface of <a href=http://naked-mole-rat.org>naked-mole-rat.org</a>, a
naked mole-rat genome resource. They had implemented a graphical
overview feature similar to that used by NCBI except the fact that it
was written using d3.</p><p>Since, I was relatively new to programming in Javascript, their
implementation really helped me to think of my approach and come up with the
implementation of mine. The initial code I wrote went under a lot of
changes with feedback from Anurag. Although we initially started with an
inspiration from NCBI&rsquo;s graphical overview (shown beside) we improved
many things over theirs e.g., the hits in our graphical overview were
sorted by e-value, a gradient color scheme to display the strength and
weakness of hits etc. We also saved these values within the <code>data-attribs</code> of
each query result (example below) so that we can quickly render the vector
graphics image.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span class=line><span class=cl>&lt;% hit.hsps.each do |hsp| %&gt;
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>  &lt;div
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>      class=&#34;hsps&#34; id=&#34;&lt;%=&#34;Query_#{query.number}_hit_#{hit.number}_#{hsp.number}&#34;%&gt;&#34;
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>      data-hsp-evalue=&#34;&lt;%= hsp.evalue %&gt;&#34; data-hsp-start=&#34;&lt;%= hsp.qstart %&gt;&#34;
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>      data-hsp-end=&#34;&lt;%= hsp.qend %&gt;&#34; data-hsp-frame=&#34;&lt;%= hsp.hframe %&gt;&#34;&gt;
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>      &lt;table class=&#34;table-hsp&#34;&gt;
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>    ..
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>  &lt;/div&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The code was then bundled as a jQuery
<a href=https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/sequenceserver/blob/14d9febd115b02fff1a98e9659e0cb756633e9c9/public/js/jquery.graphit.js>plugin</a>
(&ldquo;graphIt&rdquo;) and served minified with the custom webserver.</p><p>One of the technical challenges I want to specifically highlight is the one
where I had to figure out how to connect each high-scoring segment pair (HSP)
with a thin line as there can be multiple HSPs per hit.</p><p>In the meantime, we were upgrading to <strong>Bootstrap 3</strong> which broke and
re-broke my implementation. Each time, when I&rsquo;ll sit to
rewrite the it again, I would come up with a new and better
understanding of my code. All this however, happened only after a lot of
experimentation which I didn&rsquo;t talk about much in the post due to lack
of time. Nevertheless, there were also a bunch of critical bug fixes and
improvements in the backend code which can be followed on <a href=https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/sequenceserver/commits/graph_fixtures>GitHub</a>.</p><p>In the end, I feel that the upcoming version is much more interactive,
elegant and easy to use than the previous ones. I am excited to see it being
released for wider adoption. Here is a quick snapshot of the graphical
overview for an example BLAST hit.</p><figure class=fullwidth><img src=/images/graph.png><figcaption>Graphical summary designed using d3.js.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=epilogue>Epilogue&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#epilogue></a></h2><p>The current source code of the plugin can be found on
<a href=https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/sequenceserver/graphic_fixtures>Github</a>.
Feel free to clone and run locally on your machine. If not, an online
version has also been deployed at
<a href=http://antgeomes.org/sequenceserver>antgenomes.org/sequenceserver</a> for
convenient testing. However, I would like to point out that there will
be a lot of planned and unplanned changes happening frequently. So, if
you plan to use SequenceServer for production, please use
<a href=https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenceserver>this</a> version until we
roll out refined one (very soon).</p><p>I wanted to talk more about d3 and my plans to complete a couple of data
analysis projects with its help. However, let&rsquo;s save it for some time
later.</p></article><div class=footer><div class=footer-content><div><ul></ul><a href=# class="pure-menu-link pull-right" id=gototop-btn>↑↑</a></div></div></div></body></html>
