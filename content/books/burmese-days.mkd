My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1544925544">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Reading <em>Burmese Days</em> after 1984, indeed allows one to comprehend the maturity of Orwell's writing he showed in his later works.<br><br>Pages after pages, almost until half way through the book, Burmese Days is nothing but a good, detailed description of what's the life of an Englishman in Burma (during 1900s). However, things pick up pace when a new member, a beautiful, young <em>Ingleikma</em> joins the group of local Englishmen.<br><br>Burmese Days might leave you in confused emotional state, fuelled with a lot of questions. Whatever happened through the entire book, brought almost to a sudden, trivial halt leaves you with an uncomfortable, unsatisfying feel. Why?, you ask.
