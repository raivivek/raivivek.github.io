A collection of useful comments

Before reading the set of comments, please understand that I am not a seasoned
public speaker with years of experience. Heck! I am not even a *beginner*.

<small> *Caution: The comments below are inspired by watching a lot of other
people, reading other stories, and from my personal experiences. Naturally,
they may not be the best fit for you.* </small>

**The most important component of a presentation is the *audience*. Hence, your
goal is to ensure that whatever you present comes across clearly and is
understood by them.**

### Preparation

* It is wise to outline a rough transcript of what you are going to say and
memorize some key sentences that introduce critical slides.

* Practice at least once.

### Presentation Content

* Do not dump a large amount of content on a single slide - more than
 6 bullet points, more than 6-7 lines, less than 20 pt font size, no figure. If
 you violate any of the previous points, then please reconsider your slide.

* For short talks (10-15 min), no more than 10-12 slides. The general rule of
thumb could be to have 1-2 min per slide. I prefer to sacrifice content over
clarity in tight situations.

### General Mechanics

* Set up and check necessary equipment (microphone, laptop, laser pointer etc.,)
 before the beginning of the talk. If you are unfamiliar with anything, ask
 appropriate people for a quick how-to. Glitches during the talk can be
 demotivating if not embarrassing.

* Get a feedback of your on-stage body mechanics from your friends. Minimize any
distracting gestures.
For example, racing impatiently across the stage as if it is literally on
fire.

* Presentation is a two way communication with the audience. To do this, *make
eye-contact* with the audience. Don't bury yourself in your slides.

* Prefer to walk across the stage (or available area) once in a while to ensure
 connectivity with the whole audience.

### The Talk

* Prefer not to begin with, *"The title of my talk is foo bar"*.

* Please do not read out what is written on the slides. If there is so
much that you need to read, please refer to contents section.

* Keep judging the attention of the audience. If you sense a dip, change the
voice or movement, or pause and say something that you feel right now ("*It's
hot*", "*I can smell coffee outside*", "*Are we running late?*").

### Taking Questions

* Maintain a calm, composed body language. Make eye contact with the questioner
as you hear the complete question.

* Repeating and rephrasing (if needed) the questions is a good strategy. Ask
 the questioner if you have understood it properly and then proceed to answer
 it.

* Ask humbly, "*Did I explain myself properly?*" (puppy eyes)

* It is good to say, "*I don't know*", "*I didn't think this before*", "*Let's talk
 about it after the lecture*", or "*That is very important criticism.*"
