A collection of useful comments

Before reading these set of comments, please know that I am not a seasoned
public speaker with years of experience. Heck! I am not even a beginner.

<small> *The comments below are derived from experiences of other people, good
articles and from my own personal experiences. Please feel free to disagree or

### Content

* Do not dump a large amount of content on a single slide. Cluttered slides look
bad. Use figures, a few bullet points or lines, legible font.
* For short talks (10-15 min), no more than 10-12 slides. The general rule of
thumb could be to have 1-2 min per slide. Prefer to sacrifice content over
clarity in tight situations.

### Body Language

* Get a feedback of your on-stage body language from your friends. Minimize any
distracting gestures.
For example, racing impatiently across the stage as if it’s on fire.
* Presentation is a two way communication with the audience. To do this, *make
eye-contact* with the audience and keep them engaged. Don't bury yourself in your slides.
* Prefer to walk across the stage (or available area) once in a while to ensure
 connectivity with the whole audience.

### Preparation

* It is wise to outline a rough transcript of what you are going to say and
memorize some key sentences that introduce critical slides.
* [Practice](http://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2014/03/17/the-one-habit-that-brilliant-ted-speakers-practice-up-to-200-times/).
 And not just a little practice, but many, many hours of it.

### The Talk

* Prefer not to begin with, *"The title of my talk is foo bar"*.
* Do not read the content verbatim from the slides.
* Talk slowly and clearly at the audience. If you feel you're speaking too slowly, you're speaking at about the right speed.[4]

### Taking Questions

* Maintain a calm, composed body language. Make eye contact with the questioner
as you hear the complete question.
* Repeating and rephrasing (if needed) the questions is a good strategy. Ask
 the questioner if you have understood it properly and then proceed to answer
 it.
* It is good to say, "*I don't know*", "*I didn't think this before*", "*Let's talk
 about it after the lecture*", or "*That is very important criticism.*"
