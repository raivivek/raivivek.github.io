title: Notes from WMCB 2016
---
A mathematical and computational biology conference
---

This weekend (Jan 9 - Jan 10), I participated in a workshop on mathematical and
computational biology
([WMCB-2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160111112304/http://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~mathbio/WMCB2016/))
organized at [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research
Kolkata](http://www.iiserkol.ac.in/) (IISER-K). This annual workshop is co-sponsored
by [NNMCB](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~mbio/?q=nnmcb), a group of multiple
premier institutions in India that coordinate activities in the area of
interest.

The primary motivation for participating in this workshop was to present
my ongoing work on the knotted proteins. It seemed like a reasonable place to
attract further ideas and help. Sadly, I could not get in touch with my advisor
before the abstract submission deadline and did not submit a poster.
Nevertheless, it was fun to listen to new speakers and learn about new
developments in the field. You never know where ideas can come from.

The workshop consisted of 8 invited lectures, 6 short talks combined with
a poster session spanning over two days. There were no *hands on* or practical
sessions even though the event was called *a workshop*. I guess it is because of
the short talks, a 15-minute presentation given by Ph.D. students as about their work.

#### Venue

IISER-K is
[located](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Indian+Institute+of+Science+Education+and+Research+Kolkata/@22.962533,88.5201464,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x39f8bf0ebd68bc8b:0x92d423474389ff5c?hl=en)
about 50 km from [Kolkata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata), the nearest
metropolitan and also my home city. Located in a countryside with almost nothing
around, the new Mohanpur campus of IISER-K stands proudly with its large and
lush green beauty. Although, a few of buildings are still under construction,
the place will soon become a buzzing center of education and research in India.

#### Talks

The complete list of research talks, short talks, the list of posters can be found
on the
[website](https://web.archive.org/web/20160111112304/http://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~mathbio/WMCB2016/).
Below, I'll talk in brief about my impression of the workshop along with short
descriptions as necessary.

##### Complex systems and networks

There has been growing interest in modeling and analysis of complex biological
networks in the past decade. ([Barabasi](http://barabasilab.com/) *et al.*)
Primarily because advancement in data acquisition platforms has enabled us to
generate a huge amount of *omics* data
- genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, fluxomics to name a few.
  The variety and complexity of data has attracted specialized knowledge of
  different scientific domains, especially inter-disciplinary participation from
  physics and mathematics.

[**Sarika Jalan**](http://iiti.ac.in/people/~sarika/) heads the Complex Systems Lab at Indian Institute of Technology
Indore. She is trying to create a universal framework for a generalized
analysis of protein-protein interaction data from diseased cells. It 
will allow one to easily identify key players that cause transition from normal
to the cancerous stage.

Later, [**Indrani Bose**](http://bic.boseinst.ernet.in/indrani/), an eminent senior physicist at Bose Institute provided
a hardcore illustration of the cells as complex systems by expanding on the
topic of cell differentiation. The talk was dense but the key idea was to convey
the importance of noise and heterogeneity in the cellular system as an important
component of the decision making including cell differentiation. I will list
a couple of interesting papers she suggested for more information.

##### Big data analysis

It should no longer be surprising that a computational biology workshop involves
a large number of talks on big data analysis or *multi-omics* integration. The
talks by [**Saumyadipta Pyne**](http://www.crraoaimscs.org/faculty/spyne/) (IIPH
Hyderabad) and [**Krishna
Prasad**](http://www.iitgn.ac.in/faculty/Social%20Sciences/krishna.htm) (IIT
Gandhinagar) focused on acquisition and analysis of high dimensional data either
from single cell analysis or neuroimaging data. In these cases, often the
breakthrough is in creating a new model that describes your data instead of
trying to reduce its complexity.

##### Computational protein design

[**Pralay Mitra**](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pralay/) gave an interesting talk
outlining a general computational strategy of protein design. For those who are
unfamiliar, protein design is an inverse problem of protein folding, wherein you
start from a known structure and its sequence and work out alternative
sequences. The motivation for this problem is rather subtle as to why would
anyone want to have a different sequence for the same structure. And if different,
why not just carry out a single mutagenesis. The central idea, however, is not to
generate just a different sequence but a novel sequence with strikingly
different properties of interest. For example, we may want a protein structure
with same sequence but different affinity so that it acts as an inhibitor.
A reverse engineering problem. One may also notice that protein design problem
inherently involves a protein folding problem as well.

But how do you do it? Perhaps, I will write about it in detail in my other
posts.

##### Mechanical organization of cell

The talks by [**Anirban
Sain**](http://www.iitb.ac.in/en/employee/prof-anirban-sain) (IIT Bombay) and
[**Ranjith Padinhateeri**](http://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/~ranjith/) (IIT Bombay)
aimed to understand the mechanical organization of a cell. How does the dynamics
of cytoskeletal filaments drive shape transformation, cell division and other
processes that require force generation and modulation?

A good part about these talks were the pretty electron microscopy pictures they
show.

##### Short talks and Posters

Several short talks and posters by Ph.D. students were presented. Different
concepts like game theory, protein-protein interaction networks, molecular
dynamics simulation, spectral graph theory, and neuroscience came up in the
discussion.

##### Other

Some relevant techniques (or terms) that I wish to read upon and explore
further are:

* Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD)
* Riboswitch Scanner Tool
* Molecular Dynamics tools - Amber12, Chimera tool etc.
* Studying transient dynamics, Langevin equations

Possibly in my undergraduate thesis itself.

### Criticism

One fact that disappoints me slightly is that most of the researchers do not
really care about experimental evidence in support of the theory or analysis
they put forwardâ€”or if they do, do not have a plan about it. The general
attitude is, "*We're done. It is now up to others to build on this work and
validate.*"

We need more collaborations.

Overall, a good workshop to spend the weekend. I am glad to have made a company
of like minded people as well.
