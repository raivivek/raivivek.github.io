Wikipedia article entry for ISCB competition
---

Almost an year ago, I had written a [blog post](/old/blog/contributing-to-wikipedia-wikiprojects.html) about different Wikipedia
WikiProjects and how one could contribute to them. In short, A [WikiProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject) is simply an
organized effort by the community of editors on the Wikipedia, where they
try to curate and improve the quality of articles belonging to
a particular genre or of specific interest to a group. In loose terms, WikiProjects to Wikipedia are what
[subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/subreddits) are to [reddit](https://reddit.com).

In the same blog post, I shared my excitement about an interesting article
writing competition that I had found on [Computational Biology
WikiProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/).
The competition, organized by [International Society for Computational Biology
(ISCB)](https://www.iscb.org) awarded people for the best contributions to the
computational-biology related articles. Sadly, by the time I came across the
page, the competition for the year had already ended.

Fast forward ten months, ISCB article writing competition was
[renewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/ISCB_competition_announcement_2015)
for 2015 with an additional scope of improving Wikidata items. Call it
a coincidence, but working with [WIGI](/programming/wigi-an-inspire-grantee.html) had already provided me a good level of
familiarity with [Wikidata](http://wikidata.org/) items.

There was no time to waste!

I discussed with Nithin, a Ph.D. student in the Computational and Structural
Biology lab of my department and decided to write about [Veinna RNA Package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veinna_RNA_Package),
a popularly used bioinformatics software of RNA secondary structure prediction.
In the Wikidata category, I added a corresponding entry to [same article](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21933168) and also
improved the entry of [lac operon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311359).

Overall, one article and two Wikidata entries with an effort of few days. See all entries
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/ISCB_competition_entries_2015).

Apart from my contribution, I would also like to highlight the work done on the
[Docking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)) article by a couple of participants. Docking is an important process and
rightfully required a major expansion in content, which it did, thanks to these
people.

The results will be announced in summers, but It was a great experience to be
a part of this largely unknown effort.
