I am Vivek, a PhD student with [Program in Biomedical Sciences (PIBS)](https://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/education/phd-programs/phd-admissions)
at [University of Michigan Medical
School](https://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/). I earned my masters in
Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology
Kharagpur, India](http://iitkgp.ac.in).

This blog (fondly called *shorts*) is
a personal destination to satisfy my cravings for writing,
[science](/science.html), [code](/programming.html), and [books](books.html).

My older blog is retired and all previous posts are now
[archived](/old/index.html). A few useful posts from my older blog are:

* [BLAST+ and Its inconsistencies](https://raivivek.in/old/blog/blast-and-its-inconsistencies.html)
* [Curated List of Biology Resources - awesome/biology](https://raivivek.in/old/blog/curated-list-of-biology-resources.html)
* [Introduction to Functional Programming](https://raivivek.in/old/blog/introduction-to-functional-programming.html)

### Science

<small> <blockquote> Science provides intellectual freedom. It enables us to
explore and understand the nature of reality around us—from tiny atoms, living
cells and organisms, to the magnanimous universe. 

Doing science requires a careful and systematic investigation, perseverance, and
an unshakable curiosity to seek knowledge. However, many mistake the path of
science to be cold and lonely. It is not. It cannot be. It is the most
intellectual and largest collective experience of the mankind. 

Thus, all my efforts—internships, projects, term papers, conferences—are
a desperate reflection of my desire to become a useful member of this community,
to develop, and explore own *niche*. </blockquote> </small>

I am interested in understanding the structure of genome and its evolution at
molecular and as well as systems level, how it alters the cell phenotype and
leads to complex genetic diseases. I wish to work in *omics* driven areas that
draw heavily from integrated experimental, quantitative, and computational
approaches.

Previously, I have worked in [Dr. Gustavo
Glusman](https://www.systemsbiology.org/bio/gustavo-glusman-phd/) in [Dr. Leroy
Hood's lab](https://www.systemsbiology.org/people/faculty/hood-lab/) at
[Institute for Systems Biology](https://systemsbiology.org), and [Prof Sandhya
S Vishweswariah](http://mrdg.iisc.ernet.in/sandhyav/) at [Indian Institute of
Science, Bangalore](http://www.iisc.ac.in/).

Lastly, a (tiny) list of published, public, or in progress work where I have
made non-trivial contributions:

### Programming

I am hooked to open-source software development — an ambitious outgrowth of my
personal interest to create [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
(as in [free speech!](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FreeAsInBeer)) and
[open-source](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OpenSource) content. During summer 2016,
I was selected for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)
program, where I contributed to [OpenSNP.org](https://opensnp.org) under umbrella of Open
Bioinformatics Foundation.

I am also one of the founding members of [MetaKGP](http://wiki.metakgp.org).

Few projects with my significant contributions are:

* [OpenSNP](https://opensnp.org)
* [Sequenceserver](https://github.com/wurlmab/sequenceserver)
* [Wikidata Human Gender Indicators](http://whgi.wmflabs.org/) and [WHGI-website](https://github.com/hargup/WIGI-website)
* [Afra](https://github.com/wurlmab/afra)

I use [GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/i386/ch01s02.html.en),
keep files under [version control](https://git-scm.com/), and use [Vim](http://vim.org).

I have used Python, R, Ruby, JavaScript, MATLAB, BASH in my works.

### Interests

I am interested in the ideas of [quantified
self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self), [lateral
thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking), language and
learning, anthropology, and open-access knowledge.

### Hobbies

I enjoy hiking, playing table tennis, long walks, camping, open-spaces, and
coffee.
