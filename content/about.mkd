subtitle: About Me
---

A [biology](science.html) enthusiast with a wide spectrum of interests in
[computing](programming.html).

I write mostly on this blog and sometimes on [Quora](http://quora.com) or
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vivek_Rai).

I love to [read](books.html).

Posts from the previous blog are now [archived](https://vivekiitkgp.github.io).

#### Programming

I am hooked to open-source software development, an ambitious outgrowth of my
personal interests to create [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
(as in [freedom!](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FreeAsInBeer)) and
[open-source](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OpenSource) content.

I have learned a lot by contributing to these projects:

* [Sequenceserver](https://github.com/wurlmab/sequenceserver)
* [WIGI](https://github.com/notconfusing/WIGI) and [WIGI-website](https://github.com/hargup/WIGI-website)
* [Afra](https://github.com/wurlmab/afra)

Languages I use: Python, Ruby, Javascript, HTML/CSS, MATLAB, BASH. However,
I find Haskell to my major lifetime crush.

#### Science

A significant amount of my time is spent in nurturing my orientation towards
research through [undergraduate projects](science/journal-club-1.html), writing
term papers, [attending
conferences](https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/qsb-school-diary) and doing relevant
[internships](https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/intern-diary).

As this blog develops, I plan to write several primer
[articles](science.html) on topics in my
areas of interest.

*Coming soon*

Lastly, a record of my public published or in progress work:
