Saluton!

I am a [biology](science.html) enthusiast with a wide spectrum of interests in
[computing](programming.html). Currently pursuing my final year of integrated
master’s program at [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur,
India](http://iitkgp.ac.in). This blog (fondly called *shorts*) is a personal
destination to satisfy my cravings for [writing](http://quora.com),
[books](books.html), [code](/programming.html), and
[science](/science.html).

My older blog has retired and all posts are now [archived](/old/index.html).
A few posts of relevant interest might be:

* [BLAST+ and Its inconsistencies](http://vivekiitkgp.github.io/old/blog/blast-and-its-inconsistencies.html)
* [Curated List of Biology Resources - awesome/biology](http://vivekiitkgp.github.io/old/blog/curated-list-of-biology-resources.html)
* [Introduction to Functional Programming](http://vivekiitkgp.github.io/old/blog/introduction-to-functional-programming.html)

### Science

> Science provides intellectual freedom. It enables us to explore and understand
the nature of reality around us — from tiny atoms, living cells and organisms,
to the magnanimous universe.
>
> Doing science, however, requires a careful and systematic investigation,
perseverance, and an unshakable curiosity to seek knowledge. It is not a lone
journey. It cannot be. To do science, is to participate in the largest
collective experience of mankind.
>
> Thus, all my efforts – internships, projects, term papers,
conferences – are a desperate reflection of my desire to become a useful member
of this sport, to develop and explore own *niche*.

I am becoming increasingly interested in the systems level computational
analysis of cellular phenomenon, populations, and diseases using high-throughput
*omics* data.

As this blog develops, I plan to write several primer
[articles](science.html) on my topics of interest.

Lastly, a (tiny) list of published, public, or in progress work where I made
non-trivial contributions:

1. Priyam, Woodcroft, Rai et al. 2015. **Sequenceserver: A modern graphical user interface for custom BLAST databases.** *Biorxiv*. ([abstract](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/11/27/033142), [pdf](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/11/27/033142.full.pdf))
2. Klein, Gupta, Rai et al. 2016. **Monitoring the Gender Gap with Wikidata Human Gender Indicators**  *Opensym '16*. ([abstract](http://www.opensym.org/2016/08/16/monitoring-the-gender-gap-with-wikidata-human-gender-indicators/), [pdf](http://whgi.wmflabs.org/monitoring-gender-gap.pdf))

### Programming

I am hooked to open-source software development — an ambitious outgrowth of my
personal interest to create [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
(as in [free speech!](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FreeAsInBeer)) and
[open-source](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OpenSource) content.

I have learned a lot by contributing to these projects:

* [OpenSNP](https://opensnp.org)
* [Sequenceserver](https://github.com/wurlmab/sequenceserver)
* [Wikidata Human Gender Indicators](http://whgi.wmflabs.org/) and [WHGI-website](https://github.com/hargup/WIGI-website)
* [Afra](https://github.com/wurlmab/afra)

I use [GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/i386/ch01s02.html.en),
keep files under [version control](https://git-scm.com/), and edit using
[Vim](http://vim.org).

I have used Python, R, Ruby, JavaScript, MATLAB, BASH in my works.

### Interests

I am interested in the ideas of [quantized
self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self), [getting things
done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done), [lateral
thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking), language and
learning, history of humans, open communities, free knowledge, and societal
issues like gender biases.

I speak [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language),
[Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi), and learning
[Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) in my free time.

### Hobbies

I have an unexplored sense of adventure that is unleashed when I’m outdoors.
I enjoy hiking, playing table tennis, long no-purpose walks, sleeping under open
starry sky, camping, and watching sunset while sipping a delicious coffee.
