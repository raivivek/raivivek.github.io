Assessing gender gap on Wikipedia
---

[WIGI](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/WIGI:_Wikipedia_Gender_Index),
The Wikipedia Indicators of Gender Inequality, is a project by Maximilian Klein
[(notconfusing.com)](http://notconfusing.com) who is a PhD student at
University of California, Berkeley. The project aims at quantifying and
presenting the situation of gender gap on Wikipedia by observing the *trends of gender in biography articles*.

The obvious question that arises here is that why should we investigate the
trends in the gender of biography articles instead of the *trends in
editorship*, that is, observing the gender of the active editors on the
Wikipedia. Although, it is entirely possible that the editor-gender and
article-gender may not be related, a [prototype
research](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03086) and found [preliminary
results](http://notconfusing.com/preliminary-results-from-wigi-the-wikipedia-gender-inequality-index/)
that analyze the biography gender gap by date of birth, citizenship, and
language.

As Max quotes further in his [blog
post](http://notconfusing.com/category/thought-importance/lesser/),
> Over the last six months along with fellow Wikipedians we prototyped and
> extended this research into a paper [Gender Gap Through Time and Space: A
> Journey Through Wikipedia Biographies and the ‘WIGI’
> Index](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03086)

This paper though contains preliminary results are very less studied when
compared to other trends, offer promising insights on worldwide longitudinal
gender inequality trends.

However, these results were discussed only for a single snapshot in time and to
extend this research required further time and effort in form of a dedicated
team. With the help of a [$22,500
funding](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/05/01/meet-the-inspire-grantees/) from
[Wikipedia Inspire Grant](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Inspire), the
project has received a major impetus to implement a data portal that will
display the visualizations of the state of gender in biographies by sampling
the data on weekly basis and offer insightful statistical analyses.

The ultimate goal being to raise awareness of the gender gap using statistical
and quantitative means.

I've been fortunate enough to discover the project during its formulation
period and to be a part of it as a developer and research team contributor. The
project is open to contribution and available entirely [on
github](https://github.com/notconfusing/WIGI).
