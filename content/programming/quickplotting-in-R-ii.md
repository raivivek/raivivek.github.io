title: Quick Data Plotting in R - II

(more) Useful tips for exploratory data analysis
---

In the
[first](https://vivekiitkgp.github.io/programming/quickplotting-in-r.html) part
of the posts on R, I outlined a couple of useful strategies for quick
exploratory data analysis and visualization using R programming language. In
this post, I will share a few more examples (in a case-study like manner) along
with relevant plots for better demonstration.

#### Getting rid of artificial patterns

Plotting a graph where one or more attributes have identical values results in
a graph which looks stratified. Closely spaced points with similar values tend
to fall along a line and create artificial patterns. Consider for example,
the plot shown below where Y-axis has many identical values.

<figure> 
<img
    src="/images/non_random.png"
    title="Boxplot demo" />
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>

This artifact looks bad and hides the appearance of the data. It is difficult to
figure out which regions are denser or sparser than the others. To get rid of it,
we add a small random noise independently to the axes which have many identical
values and contribute to the artifact. It will cause the values to shift
sufficiently enough to appear dispersed without influencing your analyses (since
there perturbations are random).

```r
> dy <- runif(length(y))
> plot(x, y+dy)

# in case plotting two independent variables
> dx <- runif(length(x))
> plot(x+dx, y+dy)
```

The result:

<figure>
<img
    src="/images/dy_nonrandom.png"
    title="Noise addition demo" />
<figcaption>
Same as previous except with additional random noise.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Transparency helps

If we have a large number of data points, our scatter plot can easily become
a blob despite using `pch='.'`. A good idea in those cases is to color the
points with a level of transparency. This allows the regions of the plot with
dense cluster of points to show up as dark regions when compared to less dense
regions. It also makes it easy to spot and estimate outliers.

```r
> plot(x+dx, y+dy, col=gray(0, .5))
```

<figure>
<img
    src="/images/quad_plot.png"
    title="Transparency demo" />
<figcaption>
The <b>col</b> parameter is changed from top left (opaque) to bottom right (.3)
with increasing transparency. Notice the edges as they appear more diffused.
</figcaption>
</figure>

One can further enrich these visuals by drawing the outlier boundaries
[MAD-Median rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation)) and
coloring the points that lie outside the range.

Thatâ€™s all for now. Will add more later.
