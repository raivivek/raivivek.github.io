food for thought to many exceptional programmers. Over a year ago when I was
looking for Python mastery tips on the web, I came across &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573135/python-progression-path-from-apprentice-to-guru"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
question on StackOverflow, that laid down an ultimate path for progression from an apprentice to
guru. The highest voted answer recommended one to discover Haskell after they
have learned almost all the key features of Python and embrace
functional programming in the end. As much as I would have loved to explore it
then and there; however, it wasn't possible until two weeks ago that I could
actually delve into the subject with all my seriousness and attention. It's not
that I didn't make any effort at all during this time. It's just that I wanted
to have a guiding course that I could follow and use it to keep track of my
progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks ago, a course on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/DelftX/FP101x/3T2014"&gt;Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delft_University_of_Technology"&gt;Delft University&lt;/a&gt; kicked off on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://edx.org"&gt;edX platform&lt;/a&gt;.  I was very much influenced by the
instructor and immediately signed up for the course. Its been several weeks
now, and I must that this course has certainly met my expectations. The
instructor for this course is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Meijer_(computer_scientist)"&gt;Erik Meijer&lt;/a&gt;, a highly
acclaimed computer scientist who has been closely associated with aspects of
functional programming throughout his career &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="https://vivekiitkgp.github.io/blog/introduction-to-functional-programming.html#id5" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="https://vivekiitkgp.github.io/blog/introduction-to-functional-programming.html#id6" id="id2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. I must however say that he's
quite bold about his opinions &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="https://vivekiitkgp.github.io/blog/introduction-to-functional-programming.html#id7" id="id3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; and doesn't like the idea of spoon feeding
students. One can follow him on twitter (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/headinthebox"&gt;@headinthebox&lt;/a&gt;) for interesting updates. Exactly during
the same time, another famous researcher and computer scientist &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~huet/"&gt;Dr. Gérard
Huet&lt;/a&gt; happened to visit out campus for a two
days guest lecture on lambda calculus, type theory, functional programming, and
semantics of programming languages. I was fortunate to interact to attend his
lecture and see him in person. The lecture helped me understand the mathematical foundations of
programming language design and its semantics &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="https://vivekiitkgp.github.io/blog/introduction-to-functional-programming.html#id8" id="id4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; (being a Biotechnology
student, we don't really get to do courses on Automata Theory, or Mathematical Logic).
It was an overwhelming experience to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the particulars of course are concerned, the exercises are really nice
and encourage one to explore concepts on their own. Although the course can be
done with the help of any language that supports functional programming,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://haskell.org"&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt; is the recommended main language of the
course (that is a thing I love). Supplementary reading material is readily
provided for those who want to stay ahead of the course backed by a strong and
supportive community in the discussion forums.  The assignment deadlines are
quite stretched allowing one to comprehend material and attempt quizzes at
their pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I have been collecting all the resources that has been suggested by the
instructor or the others during the course and maintaining a list on GitHub at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/haskell"&gt;vivekiitkgp/haskell&lt;/a&gt;. It will also
contain all the code that I would write during my learning experience. However,
the course repository is hidden because the assignment dates are not yet over
and releasing solutions would be violating honor code agreement for the course.
Feel free to star and contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, as Erik would say, "Developers don't talk about code, they code".
However, I would love to post more interesting content as I delve more into
matter.&lt;/p&gt;
