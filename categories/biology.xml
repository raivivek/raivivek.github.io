content. Since its inception in 2001 &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="https://vivekiitkgp.github.io/blog/contributing-to-wikipedia-wikiprojects.html#id5" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, it has grown to over 34 million
articles and now attracts 450 million unique visitors amounting to a staggering
20 billion page views per month &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="https://vivekiitkgp.github.io/blog/contributing-to-wikipedia-wikiprojects.html#id6" id="id2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. Not to mention that it is
continually reviewed, refined and updated every moment &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="https://vivekiitkgp.github.io/blog/contributing-to-wikipedia-wikiprojects.html#id7" id="id3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of the edits made to Wikipedia are non-registered IP edits &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="https://vivekiitkgp.github.io/blog/contributing-to-wikipedia-wikiprojects.html#id8" id="id4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;, a
significant portion of the active community is focused on improving particular
sections of the site. People often team up according to their specific topic of
interest, specific location or a specific kind of task and work in an organized
manner. This results in the creation of more accurate, consistent and high-quality
articles that are often promoted to the status of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles"&gt;featured articles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GA"&gt;good articles&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, there are over &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_reports/WikiProjects_by_changes"&gt;2000
such WikiProjects&lt;/a&gt;
on English Wikipedia alone with varying level of activity. Naturally, areas
which demand specialization or expertise in a particular field (for example
Mathematics, Biology, Physics) are less active than the ones more accessible to
general public (for example places, monuments, biographies). A complete
directory of already available WikiProjects can be found &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Directory"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, when I began contributing articles to Wikipedia, a local and regional
familiarity prompted me to join the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_India"&gt;WikiProject India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_West_Bengal"&gt;WikiProject West
Bengal&lt;/a&gt; groups. Both of them had a plenty of active and experienced contributors
who would occasionally meet up and organize talks or events of interest. The community is very warm and welcoming to new users
and soon I was invited to one such meetup. Unfortunately, I couldn't attend it
because of college work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday while reading an article on Ribonucleic acids on Wikipedia, my mind
veered off for few minutes and came across the WikiProject pages of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology"&gt;Cell and
Molecular Biology&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology"&gt;Computational Biology&lt;/a&gt;.
The portal were neatly organized with significant instructions for a newcomer,
but there was hardly any noticeable recent activity. Being a computational
biology enthusiast myself, I thought this opportunity can readily be used for
learning more about the subject and at the same time contributing more articles
and content to this project. I quickly went through their scope and guidelines
articles and drafted a vague timeline and coverage of my contributions.
However, just then I came across a very interesting section on the homepage
that highlighted an international &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/ISCB_competition_announcement_2014"&gt;article writing competition&lt;/a&gt;
organized in association with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.iscb.org/"&gt;International Society for Computational Biology
(ISCB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;ISCB article competition&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The competition, running since 2012, awards students
and trainees for the best contributions to computational biology-related
articles. Entry is open internationally, to students and trainees of any
level.
We particularly encourage lecturers or course organisers to use this competition as a class assignment.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This competition runs through August-January and allows participants to submit
one article within the scope of the project, where they have added or improved
significant content. The results are judged by a committee consisting of experienced Wiki editors, and scientists with
expertise in the related field (for example, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Alexbateman"&gt;Alex Bateman&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Protein Sequence
Resources, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ebi.ac.uk/"&gt;EBI&lt;/a&gt;). The best part? A total cash prize of $1000 is awarded to the
winners. What could be better than getting paid for learning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the main goal of this post was not to encourage people to join my
efforts or channel interests specifically towards Computational Biology (I
would be more than happy if it happens). Rather to let others know about such
exciting opportunities present around us all the time, in places where we least expect them to be.
Who knows this was just one of such tons of activities
going on there? Wikipedia is full of mysteries!&lt;/p&gt;

I embarked upon this
mission recently with few contributions to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sequenceserver.com/"&gt;SequenceServer - A BLAST tool&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you set up custom BLAST+ server to perform BLAST queries with your
own database locally through a web interface. For those who are not familiar
with &lt;strong&gt;BLAST&lt;/strong&gt; or Basic Local Search Alignment Tool &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="https://vivekiitkgp.github.io/blog/easy-blast-tool-sequenceserver.html#paper" id="id1"&gt;[paper]&lt;/a&gt; - it is an algorithm which allows
quick comparison of biological sequence information which are long strings consisting
of amino acids (in case of proteins) or nucleotides (in case of nucleic acids).
It is exceedingly used by biologists all over the world to study newer
organisms, discovery of genes and finding similarity between proteins and so
on. One can see a working instance of the tool at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://antgenomes.org/blast"&gt;Ant Genomes&lt;/a&gt; website, maintained by one of the developers
and Professor at Queen Mary University London, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/staff/yannickwurm.html"&gt;Yannick Wurm&lt;/a&gt;. He's also the overseerer of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program has already completed its major part of development and its stable version
is readily available for use. However, there were many &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenceserver/issues"&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; or feature requests
that were pending and can be worked upon. I got in touch with the maintainers and submitted
three pull requests for small few bugs and a feature. It was not a big task but I was
quite motivated with this small experience of working with the community, engaging with
the developers and obviously working with git. Also, since the tool is written in Ruby, I
had to spend some time brushing up the concepts of Ruby and understanding the code structure,
and methodologies followed for the development. Ruby is a concise and appealing language which is not very tough to
understand once you are in with the flow. Anyway, I plan to continue my contribution to sequenceserver
for quite some time and also encourage you to take a look if you are even just a little bit of
Biology enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will talk more about BLAST algorithm in general in my next post.&lt;/p&gt;
