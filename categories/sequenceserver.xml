&lt;a href="http://www.sequenceserver.com"&gt;SequenceServer&lt;/a&gt;. Also, in the end I said that
I would be writing about the BLAST algorithm (which is the backbone of this project) 
and how does it works so efficiently in producing alignments even with very long 
sequences. However, In this post I would like to talk about BLAST program and 
it's output before we go into the algorithm some time later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking to &lt;a href="https://github.com/yeban"&gt;Priyam&lt;/a&gt; (one of the project
collaborators), I decided to work towards solving the &lt;a href="https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenceserver/issues/21"&gt;issue
21&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn
would help us to solve a large number of other dependent issues as well. This
was supposed to be a major improvement and I really liked the idea of it.
Especially since it was concerned with understanding the BLAST program and its
output format.

I embarked upon this
mission recently with few one of contributions to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sequenceserver.com/"&gt;SequenceServer - A BLAST tool&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you set up custom BLAST+ server to perform BLAST queries with your
own database locally or through a web interface. For those who are not familiar
with &lt;strong&gt;BLAST&lt;/strong&gt; or Basic Local Search Alignment Tool &lt;a class="citation-reference" href="https://vivekiitkgp.github.io/blog/easy-blast-tool-sequenceserver.html#paper" id="id1"&gt;[paper]&lt;/a&gt; - it is an algorithm which allows
quick comparison of biological sequence information like amino acids (in case of
proteins) or nucleotides (in case of nucleic acids). It is exceedingly used by
biologists all over the world to study newer organisms, discovery of genes and
finding similarity between proteins and so on. One can see a working instance of the tool at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://antgenomes.org/blast"&gt;Ant Genomes&lt;/a&gt; website, maintained by one of the developers and
Professor at Queen Mary University London, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/staff/yannickwurm.html"&gt;Yannick Wurm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
