          <p>Before reading the set of comments, please understand that I am not a seasoned
public speaker with years of experience. Heck! I am not even a <em>beginner</em>.</p>
<p><small> <em>Caution: The comments below are inspired by watching a lot of other
people, reading their stories, and from my personal experiences. Naturally,
they may not be the best fit for you.</em> </small></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The most important component of a presentation is the <em>audience</em>. Hence, your
goal is to ensure that whatever you present comes across clearly and is
understood by them.</strong></p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is wise to outline a rough transcript of what you are going to say and
memorize some key sentences that introduce critical slides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice. And not just a little practice, but many, many hours of it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>An effortless presentation takes hours of work.(<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2014/03/17/the-one-habit-that-brilliant-ted-speakers-practice-up-to-200-times/">2</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Presentation Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not dump a large amount of content on a single slide - more than
 6 bullet points, more than 6-7 lines, less than 20 pt font size, no figure. If
 you violate any of the previous points, then please reconsider your slide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For short talks (10-15 min), no more than 10-12 slides. The general rule of
thumb could be to have 1-2 min per slide. I prefer to sacrifice content over
clarity in tight situations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>General Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set up and check necessary equipment (microphone, laptop, laser pointer etc.,)
 before the beginning of the talk. If you are unfamiliar with anything, ask
 appropriate people for a quick how-to. Glitches during the talk can be
 demotivating if not embarrassing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get a feedback of your on-stage body mechanics from your friends. Minimize any
distracting gestures.
For example, racing impatiently across the stage as if it is literally on
fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presentation is a two way communication with the audience. To do this, <em>make
eye-contact</em> with the audience. Don't bury yourself in your slides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prefer to walk across the stage (or available area) once in a while to ensure
 connectivity with the whole audience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Talk</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prefer not to begin with, <em>"The title of my talk is foo bar"</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please do not read out what is written on the slides. If there is so
much that you need to read, please refer to contents section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep judging the attention of the audience. If you sense a dip, change the
voice or movement, or pause and say something that you feel right now ("<em>It's
hot</em>", "<em>I can smell coffee outside</em>", "<em>Are we running late?</em>").</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Taking Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maintain a calm, composed body language. Make eye contact with the questioner
as you hear the complete question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeating and rephrasing (if needed) the questions is a good strategy. Ask
 the questioner if you have understood it properly and then proceed to answer
 it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask humbly, "<em>Did I explain myself properly?</em>" (puppy eyes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is good to say, "<em>I don't know</em>", "<em>I didn't think this before</em>", "<em>Let's talk
 about it after the lecture</em>", or "<em>That is very important criticism.</em>"</p>
</li>
</ul>
