          <p>Before reading these set of comments, please know that I am not a seasoned
public speaker with years of experience. Heck! I am not even a beginner.</p>
<p><small> *The comments below are derived from experiences of other people, good
articles and from my own personal experiences. Please feel free to disagree or
improve.</small></p>
<hr />
<h3>Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not dump a large amount of content on a single slide. Cluttered slides look
bad. Use figures, a few bullet points or lines, legible font.</li>
<li>For short talks (10-15 min), no more than 10-12 slides. The general rule of
thumb could be to have 1-2 min per slide. Prefer to sacrifice content over
clarity in tight situations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Body Language</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get a feedback of your on-stage body language from your friends. Minimize any
distracting gestures.
For example, racing impatiently across the stage as if it’s on fire.</li>
<li>Presentation is a two way communication with the audience. To do this, <em>make
eye-contact</em> with the audience and keep them engaged. Don't bury yourself in your slides.</li>
<li>Prefer to walk across the stage (or available area) once in a while to ensure
 connectivity with the whole audience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is wise to outline a rough transcript of what you are going to say and
memorize some key sentences that introduce critical slides.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2014/03/17/the-one-habit-that-brilliant-ted-speakers-practice-up-to-200-times/">Practice</a>.
 And not just a little practice, but many, many hours of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Talk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prefer not to begin with, <em>"The title of my talk is foo bar"</em>.</li>
<li>Do not read the content verbatim from the slides.</li>
<li>Talk slowly and clearly at the audience. If you feel you're speaking too slowly, you're speaking at about the right speed.[3]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Taking Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maintain a calm, composed body language. Make eye contact with the questioner
as you hear the complete question.</li>
<li>Repeating and rephrasing (if needed) the questions is a good strategy. Ask
 the questioner if you have understood it properly and then proceed to answer
 it.</li>
<li>It is good to say, "<em>I don't know</em>", "<em>I didn't think this before</em>", "<em>Let's talk
 about it after the lecture</em>", or "<em>That is very important criticism.</em>"</li>
</ul>
