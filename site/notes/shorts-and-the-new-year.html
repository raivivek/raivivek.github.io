          <p>One of the main ideas behind <em>shorts</em> was to learn to formulate concise and
coherent ideas. Being able to quickly attach words to my ideas, mould
them into a simple , and bring them out for feedback. The main motivation being,
communicating my works and my science to everyone. By being concise and simple
in my approach, I would save a lot of time for myself and the readers.</p>
<p>The approach worked well. Over years, the content on the blog post grew
consistently, one article at a time, to current figure of 15.</p>
<p>How to cheat the triangle? With shorts, my primary motivation was to
bring out my ideas and work I do into the public as frequently as possible by
being concise and simpler to read and understand. In short, it would be fast and
broad.</p>

  It is incredibly hard to operate at the junction of the three areas. Producing
  work that is interesting (novel) and of high quality (good) is not going to be
  frequent (fast). <div

<p>[ Fast/Frequency, Quality/Description, Specialized/Knowledge-depth/Usefulness ]
[insert triangle image here: fast/frequent/quantity, quality, effort/time]</p>
<p>[Essentially, quantity and effort; compromise quality; quality and quantity &ndash; compromise effort; quality and effort &ndash; compromise quantity]</p>
<p>However, it is incredibly hard to cheat the triangle. If you hadn’t noticed,
I haven’t made a single new blog post in about 10 months. Granted, last year of
my life was occupied with a few critical events, most notably where I start
graduate school, It is impossible to excuse myself out of it.</p>
<p>Often times, I would start to write on something that [I feel] is important and
before I realize, the effort invested in it starts to spiral out of control.
Further, in the process of collecting and researching information for the post,
I suffer from the bias that any new reader would probably be willing to invest
the same time as I did and would quickly find the relevant material. This makes
me feel that the post is only going to be redundant, so why even bother writing
about it.</p>
<p>But thankfully, I have found several reasons for why.</p>
<p>Recently, I have come across two important realizations:
<em> People tend to grossly overestimate what others know and grossly undestimate
  what they know
</em> [something about how everything helps as long as your time &lt; other’s
  collective time you save]</p>
<p>So, what is the point of all this. In 2018, I would like to change a few things.
For this blog and for myself. </p>
<ul>
<li>Write about topics that I do not understand; as a means to teach</li>
<li>Journaling</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="things-i-want-to-achieve-in-2018">Things I want to achieve in 2018</h2>
<p>Though, planning beforehand for “resolutions” has not really worked for me in past, I would like to give it a go nonetheless. Mostly because a lot of things have personally changed for me in these years, specfically in the lane of discipline and organization. Obviously, some of it forced upon me the very nature of the vocation I have chosen for myself.</p>
