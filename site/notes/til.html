          <p>Have you ever wondered about your daily <em>Niagara of words</em>?<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p><br>
From the moment you wake up in the morning till the moment you go to bed, you
are exposed to constant sources of information. Whether it’s your morning
newspaper, your boss, a group of friends that you hang out with, or the
multitude of feed applications on your smartphone; your brain is being flooded
by a Niagara of words.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Each of these sources has the power to shape
your thoughts and inevitably your actions by carefully
<strike>manipulating</strike> controlling the nature, time and placement of the
content. Like it or not, every day you draw new inferences from things you hear
about people you may or may not know and create subtle judgments in your mind.</p>

<p>And I am not even talking about the non-informative banal talks and gossips that
you experience through regular office meetings or non-personal verbal gestures
that consume majority of our time. In fact, most of it is inevitable.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, however, you might wonder if you have learned anything
new at all. You may try hard to recall the neat command-line trick your friend
showed you or the intellectual discussion with the programmer girl in your
office, but alas, nothing comes up at all. You are too tired by now, and you
defer things for later assuming that you can find out when needed. What could
possibly be wrong?</p>
<p>Well, just that the day never comes!</p>
<p>It has been happening a lot with me. Tons of newsletters, reddit, research
papers, general news, and other links referred by friends - there’s a ton of
interesting content that I receive every day and would like to read and consume.
However, I suffer the same fate as the person described above. I have had
countless moments where I would search for a solution, only to realize that
I have had it <em>bookmarked</em> in an obscure place the last time I had the same
problem.</p>
<p>In a desperate attempt to break this loop, I have decided to start my journal of
<em>Today I Learned</em> snippets. The idea is simple. Every day, I write a small
piece of whatever new I have learned with enough description to understand
and appreciate the problem even much later.</p>
<p>It serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I document concepts that I have learned. In other words, verbalization of my
    experiences.</li>
<li>It motivates me to learn something new every day. It might be a bit tricky than
    it appears.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I sat down to write for the first time, I wondered for
a long time to find out what <em>new</em> thing I had learned. <em>It’s not easy and
that is the trick.</em></p>
<p>So far, it has only been a <a href="https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/til">few entries</a>. It
is surprisingly challenging, but I am liking it. You may wish to implement such
a journal of yours as well. And remember, it need not be about code or
technology. It can be anything that you find useful and wish to remember.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
