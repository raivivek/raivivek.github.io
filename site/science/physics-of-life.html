          <p>Frans Johansson, in his popular bestseller book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Medici_Effect:_Breakthrough_Insights_at_the_Intersection_of_Ideas,_Concepts,_and_Cultures"><em>The Medici Effect</em></a>, makes an
argument:</p>
<p><small> <blockquote> The <u>intersection</u> is the best place to innovate.
These innovations change the world in leaps along new directions by opening up
new fields, creating new information and allowing creators to become leaders.
This intersection is the place where wildly different ideas from various
areas bump into each other and build upon each other.
</blockquote> </small></p>
<p>He goes on to illustrate, with examples and appealing case studies,
how starting from artists and painters in the ancient city of Florence to the
Charles Darwin and modern day scientists, by working at the intersection, have
pushed the boundaries of knowledge and technology beyond comprehension. Such
advances have revolutionized the way we live today by integrating into the
deepest spheres of our lives.</p>
<p>But despite significant advances in recent decades, there are more questions to
explore than ever before. We are witnessing a fundamental shift in the nature
and method of the scientific discovery process from the past. Single
disciplinary science is becoming rarer, and so is the era of monogamous
collaboration. A lot of exciting stuff is coming from the people working on the
interfaces and borrowing ideas from multiple disciplines. Thanks to the
internet and digital revolution, highly collaborative and consortium like
projects are becoming a norm and are being increasingly proposed and carried
out.</p>
<p>In such a rapidly transforming world of science, it would be naive to imagine
a world of biology without the use of advances in physics, chemistry,
mathematics and engineering. That is where a program like the <a href="https://theory.ncbs.res.in/physlife2017">Physics of
Life</a> comes into the picture.</p>
<p>Physics of Life is an annual monsoon school organized by Simons Centre for Study
of Living Machines at <a href="http://www.ncbs.res.in">National Centre for Biological
Sciences</a> (NCBS), Bangalore. NCBS is a research
institute, a unit of <a href="http://www.tifr.res.in">Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research</a> (TIFR), specializing in biological research.
It is worth mentioning that TIFR and its centres are one of the top contributors to
total research output from India.<sup id="a1"><a href="#id1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The school consists of a seven-day program involving didactic lectures, research
talks, laboratory visits, interactive sessions, and a final project component.
Aimed principally at science undergraduates across all disciplines, the school
seeks to expose students to an interdisciplinary approach towards doing science,
and motivate them to seek problems at the interface of biology and other
sciences.</p>

<p>The program featured pedagogic lectures with researchers from NCBS,
<a href="http://icts.res.in">ICTS</a>, <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a>,
<a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/">IMSc</a>, <a href="http://www.jncasr.ac.in/">JNCASR</a>, and
<a href="http://www.iisc.ac.in">IISc</a> delivered to a class of 37 students. Mukund
Thattai kick-started the school with a preview of numbers in biology and
building the motivation of problem-solving using reasoned estimates and
scientific methodology. <a href="http://www.imsc.res.in/~rsidd/">Rahul Siddhartan</a> from
IMSc talked about modeling biological sequences with a brief review of Bayesian
probability, Markov models, and alignment algorithms.</p>
<p>From Monday to Wednesday, <a href="http://www.jncasr.ac.in/jain/">Kavita Jain</a> from JNCASR talked about the modern synthesis
of evolution and how it has evolved from Darwin&rsquo;s original ideas from <em>The
Origin of Species</em>. With a discussion on important evolutionary processes, she
delved into ideas of population genetics using simple models (Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium, Wright-Fisher process for example) to understand the role of genetic drift, mutation,
selection and stochasticity in a population.  <a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~manojg">Manoj Gopalkrishnan</a> from IIT
Bombay talked about implications of life and what does it mean to be living,
from a biological and physical point of view. He then build upon those ideas to
draw a parallel between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory"> thermodynamics of a cell and information theory</a>,
discussing the design and limitations of <a href="https://www.auburn.edu/~smith01/notes/maxdem.htm">Maxwell&rsquo;s demon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Szilard_engine&amp;redirect=no">Szilard&rsquo;s engine</a>;
and finally building towards The Szilard-Landauer Correspondence.<sup id="a2"><a href="#id2">2</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="https://home.icts.res.in/~vijay/">Vijay Krishnamurthy</a> from ICTS studies physical biology and soft-condensed matter
physics, and he built upon the same ideas. Posing questions like <em>What states
of matter are biological systems in and how are they constituted?</em> He provided
a conceptual background of Brownian motion and how a study of dynamics from the
related principles (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system">Reaction-diffusion system</a>, for example) could give rise to complex emergent phenomenon such as <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/02/turing-patterns/">Turing
patterns</a> formation—an
interesting study of which is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486416/">digit patterning in a mouse</a>. Coming from
a biological background, I was highly impressed by Vijay&rsquo;s lecture and the way
he told his story.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Mukund Thattai got back to his ideas from the first day and posed
a question on the precision of life. Specifically, <em>how precise is life and
how is his precision generated?</em> For demonstration, he discussed the famous
paper by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/911982">Berg and Purcell (1977)</a>.
However, in his approach, he relied very little on the directly borrowing ideas
from the article and instead discussed the assumptions and approach from the ground
up. In fact, he went as far as to derive and explain the calculation of sample mean
and variance. In his last lecture, he discussed his paper on stochastic/noisy
expression of single gene and modeled its dynamics.<sup id="a3"><a href="#id3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.ncbs.res.in/faculty/sandeep">Sandeep Krishna</a> from NCBS held an interactive session in which we had
to borrow ideas from biological systems and develop them into a playable game.
A few exciting games from the session are now posted on the <a href="https://simonsgamesblog.wordpress.com/">Simons Games
blog</a>.</p>
<p>On the final day before the presentation, <a href="https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/">Vishu Guttal</a> from IISc focused on broader
ecological aspects of evolution discussing how organisms interact with each
other in a community and ways to understand their behavior theoretically and
empirically. A famous example of predator-prey dynamics was also discussed.</p>
<p>Finally, on the last day we had a career counseling session where we discussed
exciting aspects of continuing in science and what does it mean to do research
as a PhD student and a PI. The take home lesson was that a PhD is not supposed
to be a world changing exercise or an attempt at becoming the best in the world
(what most students suggested). Rather, it is more of an independent exercise
and a critical milestone towards gaining exposure to the field of research:
a form of apprenticeship but with more independence and a demand of novelty and
rigor. Following this session, different groups presented what they have been
working on during the school.</p>

<p>Overall, the school provided a must-needed brush up after months of hiatus due
to summer vacations. Discussions with professors and how they are doing science
raised some interesting questions that I have been thinking about. I am hoping to
share some of it shortly. However, I also feel that the lecture-style
theme of the school along with the depth to which the contents were covered are
more suitable for junior students, preferably those in their sophomore or junior
years. Lastly, the school provided an excellent opportunity to meet new friends and
learn from their interest and enthusiasm.</p>
