          <p>Posted below is an email that I rediscovered in my mailbox a few days ago. I had
no memory of it whatsoever, perhaps because I never received a reply from the
intended recipient. Whatever be the reasons, looking back at it today feels like
discovering a diamond in the rough.</p>
<p>The letter is an outcome of my personal struggle. The conundrums of an aspiring
researcher - <em>where do my moral and ethical standards of science? where do they
belong in the existing framework of academia? what’s there for me?</em></p>
<p>I have come a long way in understanding these questions; in being able to answer
them for myself. However, the journey is not over yet. As Albert Einstein
once remarked, <em>“The important thing is not to stop questioning.”</em></p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre>Dear Prof. XXX:

I&#39;m sorry for coming up to you with frequent questions. However, it is
something that is bugging me for some time, and I am hopeful that your
ideas will be of great help in improving my understanding. I will
refrain from providing a context at the moment as it may act as a
primer.

I have grown through years in close unison with areas of computer
science, where there is a tradition of publishing ideas in conferences
and doing things in open aka open-source way. This ideology has
influenced me a lot, and I have striven to appropriately license my
work in a manner that allows maximum reuse and persistence even if the
work has just started. However, I realize that this tradition is far
from true in domains like biology. There is an invisible force pushing
for secrecy, patents, rights protection, publish-or-perish. People
want to preserve ideas first at any cost, irrespective of whether
they&#39;ll ever work on that idea or not. I guess most of these arise to
internal competition on funding and other resources. But anyway.

I wish to know your ideas on ethics and ways of doing science,
especially in the context of topics above. Do you think it open
research, open science is an unaccepted methodology in the current
state of scientific development? What advantages does working behind
the screens bring compared to the mutually sharing knowledge and
working for advancement in general? Or is it that everything boils
down to an act of garnering fame and funding in academia since these
two are highly likely to affect the success rate (and research rate)
for anyone? What do you think of pre-publication?

Sorry if I jumbled up a lot of questions in the last paragraph. Please
take your time to respond :)

Sincerely,
Vivek
