          <p>Almost an year ago, I had written a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/old/blog/contributing-to-wikipedia-wikiprojects.html">blog post</a> about different Wikipedia
WikiProjects and how one could contribute to them. In short, A <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject">WikiProject</a> is simply an
organized effort by the community of editors on the Wikipedia, where they
try to curate and improve the quality of articles belonging to
a particular genre or of specific interest to a group. In loose terms, WikiProjects to Wikipedia are what
<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/subreddits">subreddits</a> are to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://reddit.com">reddit</a>.</p>

<p>In the same blog post, I shared my excitement about an interesting article
writing competition that I had found on <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/">Computational Biology
WikiProject</a>.
The competition, organized by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.iscb.org">International Society for Computational Biology
(ISCB)</a> awarded people for the best contributions to the
computational-biology related articles. Sadly, by the time I came across the
page, the competition for the year had already ended.</p>

<p>Fast forward ten months, ISCB article writing competition was
<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/ISCB_competition_announcement_2015">renewed</a>
for 2015 with an additional scope of improving Wikidata items. Call it
a coincidence, but working with <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/programming/wigi-an-inspire-grantee.html">WIGI</a> had already provided me a good level of
familiarity with <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> items.</p>

<p>There was no time to waste!</p>

<p>I discussed with Nithin, a Ph.D. student in the Computational and Structural
Biology lab of my department and decided to write about <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veinna_RNA_Package">Veinna RNA Package</a>,
a popularly used bioinformatics software of RNA secondary structure prediction.
In the Wikidata category, I added a corresponding entry to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21933168">same article</a> and also
improved the entry of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311359">lac operon</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, one article and two Wikidata entries with an effort of few days. See all entries
<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/ISCB_competition_entries_2015">here</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from my contribution, I would also like to highlight the work done on the
<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)">Docking</a> article by a couple of participants. Docking is an important process and
rightfully required a major expansion in content, which it did, thanks to these
people.</p>

<p>The results will be announced in summers, but It was a great experience to be
a part of this largely unknown effort.</p>
