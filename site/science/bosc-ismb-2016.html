          <p>This year I attended the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) from
July 8-12 in Orlando, Florida. But before I talk about my experience of the
conference (and amazing Disney World!), let me roll back a bit and tell you
about why I was there.</p>

<h3 id="iscb-competition">ISCB Competition</h3>
<p>Several months ago, I wrote a <a href="wikiproject-submission.html"><em>short</em></a> describing my submission for ISCB
Wikipedia article writing competition. For those who don’t know, the competition
invited people to improve upon existing computational biology articles on
Wikipedia by adding or improving upon existing resources. The simple
aim of the initiative was to propagate the idea of open-science and
open-research, and to encourage collective community efforts for knowlege
curation.</p>
<p>So, after the official editing period finished in January, I got busy in other
college activities and nearly forgot about it until one day in June when
I received an email from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bateman">Alex
Bateman</a>. He let me know, much to my
suprise and joy, that my contributions were judged in top 3 by the review
committee; and if I would like to come to ISMB 2016 and receive the award
in person. He also generously agreed to partially sponsor my travel
and accommodation for the conference!</p>
<p>Few weeks later, I am walking through the meandering hallways of the conference
venue and decks of the wonderful Disney World resort marveling at the sheer
scale of the conference—thousands of people from all over the world and in
all-ranks enthusiastically swarming around conference halls and ball rooms for
poster sessions, talks, and getting to see their colleagues and collaborators.</p>
<h3 id="bosc-ismb-and-dinner">BOSC, ISMB, and Dinner!</h3>
<p>Since I went a day before the main conference was scheduled to start, I could
attend a half day session of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust">BOSC</a>, a special interest group
meeting, organized two days before ISMB. Bastian Greshake, founder of OpenSNP
and also my mentor for Google Summer of Code project, gave a talk about latest
developments with the project. It was a fun experience to see my name feature
twice on presentations as a Google Summer of Code student for OBF and OpenSNP.
In the evening, I joined about 20 other people including <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/">Peter
Cock</a> (lead
developer of BioPython), <a href="https://github.com/sjackman">Shaun Jackman</a> (developer
of LinuxBrew), <a href="http://ruleofthirds.de/">Bastian Greshake</a> (founder of
OpenSNP.org), and <a href="http://www2.lbl.gov/msd/people/investigators.html">Nomi
Harris</a> (co-chair of BOSC
‘17) for a dinner in Orlando city.</p>
<p>The main ISMB conference started from next day. It was, however, a struggle to
wake up at 9 am in the morning while I was still jetlagged. I missed the morning
keynotes for two consecutive days. Additionally, it was difficult to decide
which talks to attend since I neither had any speaker preference nor I knew any
of them. I followed the talk descriptions and went to the ones I liked—mostly
related to challenges of big-data and machine learning Biology.</p>
<p>Later that day, I met with Alex Bateman and we discussed about organizing the
Wikipedia editathon the next day. He also introduced me to Alastair K.,
a post-doctoral student at UCSD and also one of the former winners of the ISCB
competition.</p>

<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t explore much of area around Disney resort the previous day,
I used the rest of my evening to enjoy the atmosphere and explore dinner
options. Finding food, however, turned out to be a struggle. Unless you can
live on french fries and coke, or are ready to burn holes in your wallet (not
a problem if your expenses are reimbursed), moving around and relying on Disney
World eateries is best to be avoided. Guess which one I did?</p>
<p>Next morning, I met with Alex and Alastair again. We reviewed the wiki presentation and
a general workflow of the editathon to be organized later that evening. During
the poster session, Alex Bateman also introduced me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Teichmann">Sarah
Teichmann</a>, Head of Cellular
Genetics at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust">Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute</a>, one of
the keynote speakers of the conference. For the rest of the day, I moved around
the venue skimming posters and listening to the presentors. It was quite
a coincidence when I run into Johannes Koster, one of the lead contributors to
Bioconda project. He was quick to recognize my name since I had contributed
couple <em>recipes</em> to the project. It&rsquo;s surprising how small the world can be
sometimes. There were also a couple of funny instances when people mistook me
for a graduate student, but I realize that is a safe question to ask since there
were many graduate students at the conference.</p>

ISMB Wikipedia Editathon 2016
</p>

<p>After the poster session was over, we conducted the editathon as planned. Alex
led the editing session with a few demonstrations done by Alastair, while I was
available as an assistant if someone faced any issues. We attracted a moderate
crowd (~20 people) of interesting people. The important takeaway lessons from
the workshop are documented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/ISMB_2016_Editathon">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, by the end of the day, the immense excitement of people around me and
the buzz of science overwhelmed me. I felt like I am missing something.</p>
<p>Later that night, I spent some time walking around the beautiful decks of the
resort area ruminating over the overwhelming thought I had earlier. It was an
unbelievingly beautiful night. Occasional fireworks washed the clear sky with
colors often shadowing the vibrant brightness of lights that decorated the
decks. Children enjoyed night performances by several artists while adults
paused to spare a few intermittent laughs. Slowly I understood the true nature
of my uneasiness.</p>
<p class="side-card go-left">
Mixed feelings
</p>

<p>I was not sad, scared or intimidated because of the scale of the conference and
science involved. I was sad because I too wanted to be a part of that community.
The event triggered a deep seated longing in my heart, the satisfaction of
working on your passion and proudly presenting it to the world—for all the
accolades and criticism it has to offer. I felt a deep sense of understanding as
I walked back to my room to get some sleep and prepare for the final day of the
conference.</p>
<p>Next day, also the final day of the conference, I hopped through some sponsor
exhibits and collected a few t-shirts and goodies. Finally, my excitement
surged to its peak when the awards ceremony began as the culminating element of
the conference.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great experience—made possible only due to generous efforts of
Alex Bateman, and Gustavo Glusman, my mentor at Institute for Systems Biology.
I made several friends, met influential people, and above all, took a closer
look at the cutting-edge research research of the field.</p>
<p>See you at ISMB/ECCB 2017 conference in Prague next year!</p>
