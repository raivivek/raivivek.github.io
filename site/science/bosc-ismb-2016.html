          <p>This year I attended the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) from
July 8-12 in Orlando, Florida. But before I talk about my experience of the
conference (and amazing Disney World!), let me roll back a bit and tell you
about why I was there.</p>

<h3>ISCB Competition</h3>

<p>Several months ago, I wrote a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="wikiproject-submission.html"><em>short</em></a> describing my submission for ISCB
Wikipedia article writing competition. For those who don’t know, the competition
invited people to improve upon existing computational biology articles on
Wikipedia by adding or improving upon existing resources. The simple
aim of the initiative was to propagate the idea of open-science and
open-research, and to encourage collective community efforts for knowlege
curation.</p>

<p>So, after the official editing period finished in January, I got busy in other
college activities and nearly forgot about it until one day in June when
I received an email from <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bateman">Alex
Bateman</a>. He let me know, much to my
suprise and joy, that my contributions were judged in top 3 by the review
committee, and whether I would like to come to ISMB 2016 and receive the award
in person if possible. He also generously agreed to partially sponsor my travel
and accommodation for the conference!</p>

<p>A few weeks later, I was walking through the meandering hallways of the
conference venue, the wonderful Disney World resort, marveling at the sheer
scale of the conference—thousands of people from all over the world,
enthusiastically swarming around conference halls and ball rooms.</p>

<h3>BOSC, ISMB and Dinner!</h3>

<p>Since I went a day before the main conference was scheduled to start, I could
attend a half day session of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust">BOSC</a>, a special interest group meeting, organized
two days before ISMB. Bastian Greshake, founder of OpenSNP and also my mentor
for Google Summer of Code project, gave a talk about latest developments with
the project. It was a fun experience to see my name feature twice on
presentations as a Google Summer of Code student for OBF and OpenSNP. In the
evening, I joined about 20 other people including <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/">Peter
Cock</a> (lead
developer of BioPython), <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/sjackman">Shaun Jackman</a> (developer
of LinuxBrew), <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://ruleofthirds.de/">Bastian Greshake</a> (founder of
OpenSNP.org), and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www2.lbl.gov/msd/people/investigators.html">Nomi
Harris</a> (co-chair of BOSC
‘17) for a dinner in Orlando city.</p>

<p>The main ISMB conference started from next day. It was, however, a struggle to
wake up at 9 am in the morning while I was still jetlagged. As a result,
I missed the morning keynotes for consecutive two days. Furthermore, it was
really hard to decide which talks to attend since I did not know many of the
speakers. I followed the talk descriptions and went to the ones I liked—mostly
related to challenges of machine learning and big-data in Biology. Later that
day,
I met with Alex Bateman and we discussed about organizing the Wikipedia
editathon the next day. He also introduced me to Alastair K., a post-doctoral
student at UCSD and also one of the former winner of the ISCB competition.</p>

</p>

<p>Since I didn&#8217;t explore much of area around Disney resort the previous day,
I used the rest of my evening to enjoy the atmosphere and explore dinner
options. Finding food, however, turned out to be a real struggle. Unless you can
live on french fries and coke, or are ready to burn holes in your wallet (not
a problem if your expenses are reimbursed), moving around and relying on Disney
World eateries is best to be avoided. Guess which one I did?</p>

<p>zzz&#8230;</p>

<p>Next morning, I met Alex and Alastair again. We reviewed the presentation and
a general workflow of the editathon to be organized later that evening. Alex also
introduced me to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Teichmann">Sarah Teichmann</a>, Head of Cellular Genetics at the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust">Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute</a>, one of
the keynote speakers of the conference. For the rest of the day, I spent time
walking around the posters and listening to the presentors. It was quite
a coincidence when I run into Johannes Koster, one of the lead contributors to
Bioconda project. He was quick to recognize my name since I had made several
contributions to the repository. It&#8217;s surprising how small the world can be
sometimes. There were also a couple of
funny instances when people mistook me for a graduate student.</p>

<p>By the end of it, however, I felt overwhelmed and slighty sad too. I felt like
I am missing something.</p>

ISMB Wikipedia Editathon 2016
</p>

<p>After the poster session was over, we conducted the editathon as planned. Alex
led the editing session with a few demonstrations done by Alastair, while I was
available as an assistant if someone faced any issues. We attracted a moderate
crowd (~20 people) of interesting people. The important takeaway lessons from
the workshop are documented <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/ISMB_2016_Editathon">here</a>.</p>

<p>Later that night, I spent some time walking around the beautiful decks of the
resort area, ruminating over the overwhelming thought I had earlier. It was an
unbelievingly beautiful night. Occasional fireworks washed the sky with colors
often shadowing the vibrant brightness of lights that decorated the decks.
Children enjoyed night performances by several artists, while adults paused to
spare a few intermittent laughs. That’s when I understood the true nature of my
emotional uneasiness.</p>

<p class="side-card go-left">
Mixed feelings
</p>

<p>I was not sad, scared or intimidated because of the scale of the conference and
science involved. I was sad because I too wanted to be a part of that community.
The event triggered a deep seated longing in my heart, the satisfaction of
working on your passion and proudly presenting it to the world—for all the
accolades and criticism it has to offer. I felt a deep sense of understanding as
I walked back to my room to get some sleep and prepare for the final day of the
conference.</p>

<p>Next day, also the final day of the conference, I hopped through some sponsor
exhibits and collected a few tee-shirts and goodies. Finally, my excitement
surged to its peak when the awards ceremony began as the culminating element of
the conference.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great experience—made possible only due to generous efforts of
Alex, and Gustavo Glusman, my mentor, at Institute for Systems Biology in
sponsoring my expenses. I made several friends, met influential people, and
above all, took a closer look at the cutting-edge research research of the
field.</p>

<p>See you at ISMB/ECCB 2017 conference in Prague next year!</p>
