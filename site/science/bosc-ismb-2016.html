          <p>This year I went to attend the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB)
from July 8-12 in Orlando, Florida. But before I talk about my experience of the
conference (and amazing Disney World!), let me roll back a bit and tell you
about why I was there.</p>
<p><img alt="Wiki editathon ISMB 2016.jpg" src="https://www.iscb.org/images/stories/ismb2016/downloads/ISMB2016_vertical.jpeg" height="240" width="200"></a></p>
<h3>ISCB Competition</h3>
<p>Several months ago, I wrote a [<em>short</em>] () describing my submission for ISCB
Wikipedia article writing competition. For those who don’t know, the competition
invited people to improve upon existing computational biology articles on
Wikipedia by adding or improving upon existing existing resources. The simple
aim of the initiative was to propagate the idea of open science and open
research and to encourage collective community efforts to curate knowledge.</p>
<p>So, after the official editing period finished in January, I got busy in other
college activities and nearly forgot about it until suddenly I received an email
from Alex Bateman in June. Long story short, my contributions were judged in top
3 by the review committee, so Alex invited me to ISMB and receive the award in
person if possible.</p>
<p>A week later, I was meandering around the hallways of wonderful Disney World
resort marveling at the sheer scale of the conference. Thousands of people from
all over the world, enthusiastically swarming around conference halls and ball
rooms </p>
<h3>BOSC, ISMB and Dinner!</h3>
<p>Since I went a day before the main conference was scheduled to start, I was able
to catch half day session of BOSC, a special interest group meeting, organized
two days before ISMB. Bastian Greshake, my mentor for Google Summer of Code
project, presented his talk on OpenSNP. It was a fun experience to my name
feature twice on presentations as a Google Summer of Code student for OBF and
OpenSNP. In the evening, I joined about 20 other people including Peter Cock
(lead developer of BioPython), Shaun Jackman (developer of LinuxBrew), Bastian
Greshake (founder of OpenSNP.org), and Nomi Harris (co-chair of BOSC ‘17) for
a dinner in main Orlando.</p>
<p>The main ISMB conference started from next day. It was, however, a struggle to
wake up at 9 am in the morning while I was still jetlagged. As a result,
I missed both the morning keynotes. It was really hard to decide which talks to
attend since I did not know many of the speakers. I followed the talk
descriptions and went to the ones I liked - mostly related to tackling
challenges of big data and machine learning. Later that day, I met with Alex
Bateman and we discussed about organizing the Wikipedia editathon the next day.
He also introduced me to Alaistair K., a PhD student and also one of the former
winner of the ISCB competition.</p>

</p>

<p>Finding food in Disney was a real struggle. Unless you are reimbursed for your
expense, or are holidaying, moving around and relying on Disney World eateries
will definitely burn your wallet. However, I survived somehow. I had to.</p>
<p>Next morning, I met Alex and Alaistair again. We reviewed the presentation and
a general workflow of the editathon to be organized the same evening. Alex also
introduced us to Sarah Teichmann, [inset her workplace] one of the keynote
speakers of the conference. Throughout the day, I spent quite some time walking
to the posters and listening to the details. It was an overwhelming experience
and somewhat sad too. I felt like I am missing something.</p>

</p>

<p>After the poster session was over, we conducted the editathon as planned. Alex
led the editing session with a few demonstrations done by Alaistair, while I was
available as an assistant if someone faced any issues. We attracted a moderate
crowd (~20 people) of interesting people. The important takeaway lessons from
the workshop are document here.</p>
<p>Later that night, I spent some time walking around the beautiful decks of the
resort area, ruminating over the overwhelming thought I had earlier. It was an
unbelievingly beautiful night. Occasional fireworks washed the sky with colors
often shadowing the vibrant brightness of lights that decorated the decks.
Children enjoyed night performances by several artists, while adults paused to
spare a few intermittent laughs. That’s when I understood the true nature of my
emotional uneasiness.</p>

Mixed feelings
</p>

<p>I was not sad, scared or intimidated because of the scale of the conference and
science involved. I was sad because I too wanted to be a part of that community.
The event triggered a deep seated longing in my heart, the satisfaction of
working on your passion and proudly presenting it to the world - for all the
accolades and criticism it has to offer. I felt a deep sense of understanding as
I walked back to my room to sleep and prepare for the final day of the
conference.</p>
<p>Next day, also the final day of the conference, I hopped through some sponsor
exhibits and collected a few tee-shirts and goodies. Finally, my excitement
surged to its peak when the awards ceremony began as the culminating element of
the conference.</p>
