          <p>Journal Club is a weekly paper presentation session organized in our department
by us, where one could present an remarkable research finding,
discuss a new experimental technique or simply introduce everyone to a new or
less explored field in the area of biology. I have mentioned about this
initiative in my earlier posts, and it is something that I really feel excited
to talk about. The audience size is pretty decent (around 15-20 people)
consisting of professors, research scholar, graduates and undergraduate
students.</p>

<p>This semester marked the second session of our initiative, and I had the
opportunity to speak to people about a topic of my interest i.e., Knotted
Proteins. Since I didn&rsquo;t have much time to do a thorough literature survey, I
summarized a <em>review-like</em> presentation of the topic along with the motivation
of study, questions we ask, and general techniques and approaches adopted by
the scientists. I thought that explaining a protein knots can be greatly
simplified by using a rope, and it did. I used it throughout my talk to convey
several important ideas like <em>closure</em>, <em>crossing number</em>, <em>deep and shallow
knots</em> etc.</p>
<p>The talk was well received, and I&rsquo;m glad to have raised a lot of questions in
everyone&rsquo;s mind. I received several questions and duly addressed them to the
best of my knowledge and with assistance from research scholars in the audience
who had worked on similar protein structures. The discussion was fruitful, and
I received numerous questions from my fellow class mates as well.</p>
<p>A crucial feedback that I received post presentation was that I should include
some experimental (<em>hands on</em>) studies which prevent the talk from being tagged
as plain theoretical and boring.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a good experience, and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to further
chances to speak again.</p>
<p>My presentation for the talk can be found

A video will be uploaded shortly as well.</p>
