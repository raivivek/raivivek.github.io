<p>THEY SAY EXPERIENCE IS THE best teacher and unless you have had a moment during
your work when you scream, "Never do it this way again!", you haven't really
learned it to your heart.</p>

<p>The two crucial summers of my fresher and sophomore years were mostly spent
exploring new subjects and trying out everything that I can. I was greatly (I
am!) interested in programming and spent considerable time learning algorithms,
doing competitive programming, using Python, and mastering tools like Vim and
git. It was a time spent well.</p>
<p>However, during this time, exposure to various aspects of biology opened to me
an altogether new world - a fascinating, microscopic, <em>living</em> world, the
organization and structure of which cannot be matched even by our sophisticated
societies. It is my effort to take a closer look at this world and understand
its underlying intricacy that brought me to <strong>Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore</strong>.</p>
<p>Selected through the <strong>B</strong>io <strong>E</strong>ngineering <strong>S</strong>ummer <strong>T</strong>raining program
(BEST), I'll be spending two months in <a href="http://www.mrdg.iisc.ernet.in/sandhyav/index.htm">Prof. Sandhya S.
Visweswariah</a> lab,
<a href="http://www.mrdg.iisc.ernet.in/">MRDG</a> department, with Pradeep S. working on
<em>Characterization of pore forming toxin ClyA in E. coli</em>.</p>
<p>The program has been nicely designed and also includes regular lectures,
seminars, interactive sessions and special talks. It has been a week since the
program started, and I'm throughly enjoying my stay within the lab. The
interaction with people working in the lab, attending grilling lab meetings,
discussions with professor, all have enriched my understanding and experience
of research.</p>
<p>I feel responsible for the work I do and every moment that I spend in lab, and
it is in this regard that I have decided to document my daily and weekly
activities in a neatly maintained log book. These logs will describe the
experiments I undertook in lab, any papers I read, or any profound personality
or even a friend that I met. This will not only serve as a milestone but also
help as a marker to recollect and present whatever I have been able to learn.
This <strong>intern diary</strong> is maintained at <a href="https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/intern-diary">my
github</a> profile and publicly
accessible. I will be glad to have any pair of eyes going through them and
offering their constructive criticism - regarding any approach I took or any
mistake I made.</p>
<p>While you may get a bit of idea about my work from these logs, I shall reserve
the details for another post, mostly in order to stick to the essence of
creating <em>shorts</em>.</p>
