          <p>1 day. 6 people. 3 places.</p>
<p>Winter school was on in full swing with intensive pre-school and serious
discussions that often spilled over to the relatively relaxed moments of
intermittent breaks. Everyone was craving for a day break. Participants not from
India desperately wanted to shop around the city and see new places, and
regulars just wanted to retire to their homes and enjoy a jolly weekend.</p>
<p>By Saturday night, almost everyone had deserted the campus (except those who
explicitly didn't want to). I don't know how it happened (thanks to Sanjay
Lamba), but six of us got together and agreed upon a Mysore rendezvous.</p>
<p>That journey turned out to be one of my most momentous journeys so far!</p>
<p>We set out at 4 am in the morning from ICTS campus. I didn't sleep the night
before hoping that I'd get a sleep in the car instead. Unfortunately, my wishes
were granted half-heartedly as I could sleep only for an hour or two.</p>
<h4>Passing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore">Mysore</a></h4>
<p>Mysore (now called Mysuru) has a delightful skyline! The background is
consistently spotted with hills, trying to shade the city from bright rays of
sun. Occasionally, these hills would have a temple or fort at their summits,
although appearing to me as miniature models from the distance.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the way, we decided to skip Mysuru for now and move ahead to Bandipur
National Park and Tiger Reserve. It was roughly an hour of drive from
Mysore.</p>
<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandipur_National_Park">Bandipur National Park</a></h4>
<p>We reached Bandipur National Park at around 9.15 am. Interestingly, two national
highways are built through the tiger reserve, allowing one to pass along
stretches where one could easily spot an elephant or deer. Driving slowly, we
reached the official army station and parked the car. Suddenly, we learned that
last safari ride for the jungle was leaving in 5 minutes. It was going to be my
first safari ride of life!</p>
