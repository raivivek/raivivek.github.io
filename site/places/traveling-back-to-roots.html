        <p>This Druga Puja, I took leave from the enormous, bustling crowd of metropoliton
city and traveled with my family back to our ancestral home. The current place
in the heart of the city has been my home only for a decade. We moved here when
I was learning my alphabets in search of better education and life. Looking
over the past, the idea of coming here feels to be one of the best decisions
ever taken. However, we did take out a couple of months time to make sure we
visit our rest of the big family every year, typically during the summers.</p>
<p>It is a tiny
village consisting of population barely crossing few thousands. However, as
small this figure may seem, all of this population is nicely accomodated in
well build <em>pukka</em> houses (made of brick, cement and concrete) with a marginal
fraction owning or living in <em>clay</em> houses. Earlier when I was a kid, all of my
family used to travel every summer - thanks to 2 months of summer vacation that
all of us siblings had during schooltime.</p>
