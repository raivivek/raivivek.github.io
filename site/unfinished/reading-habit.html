<p>Reading is one of the fundamental habits that we learn as a child. Even before our
temporal abilities are decently developed (usually by the end of third month
after birth), people sing songs, lullabies, read stories or make interesting noises
to stimulate our brain. Not much later, reading becomes out favorite activity where
we have already irritated our parents to read <em>Winnie-the-Pooh</em> over and again
for umpteenth time. This habit, however, grows only up to the teenage years and
then starts to diminish, only to increase again later in life.<a href="http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED496343.pdf">1</a></p>
<p>A simple Google search yields thousands of blog posts, articles and research
papers discussing the benefits. Although, all of those can be discussed in much
finer details and every point be further analyzed, it suffices to say that reading
is important for personal development and growth of social, economic and civic
life (Holden, 2004); almost as if it a prerequisite for all cultural and social
activities. Not only one becomes a better reader, writer and self-confident
person but also <em>creative</em> by experience other worlds and newer roles in
imagination.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all
we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and
all there ever will be to know and understand.”
