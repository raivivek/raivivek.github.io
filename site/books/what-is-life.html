        <blockquote>
<p>If a man never contradicts himself, the reason must be that he virtually
never says anything at all.</p>
<p>Erwin Schrödinger</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin
Schrödinger</a>, an eminent
physicist and Nobel Prize winner, the book <strong>What is Life?</strong> (<a href="http://whatislife.stanford.edu/LoCo_files/What-is-Life.pdf">get
here</a>) is an attempt
to understand the aspects of life as manifested by living organisms. As
philosophical it may sound, the author instead attempts to understand the
organization and behavior of <em>life</em> -- individual cells to higher organism,
from the point of a physicist. The book is appealing even to lay readers and
builds on important conceptual constructs of physics without delving into too
much mathematical formulations. If this sounds an unnecessary arrangement
to you, as to why do we bother so much about it since we already know a lot
about DNA, cells and their organization, then please prepare yourself to answer
these simple questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial
boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?</p>
<p>Why must our bodies be so large compared with the atom? ... Must be that so?
Is there an intrinsic reason for it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As trivial as these may appear, Schrödinger discusses the underlying ideas
(and potential answers) with such grace and lucidity that the corresponding
subject treatment bestows an entirely new perspective in your mind. And All
you'll be left with is a tingling sensation and curiosity to seek for answers.</p>
<p>This book also helps us to reconcile the efforts of scientists who have made
contributions in answering such naive (if we think) questions back then to the
amplitude of knowledge and understanding we have gathered today.</p>
