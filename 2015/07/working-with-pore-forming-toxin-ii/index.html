<p>This chinese proverb accurately describes my summer experience at the Indian
Institute of Science this year. After weeks of hard work &ndash; wet-lab
experiments with long hours, nearly two hours of commute everyday, and
precarious meal planning &ndash; my internship finally concluded on July 10 after
eight long weeks (May 11 - July 10).</p>
<p>As described before, the core of my project was to characterize the assembly
and pore-formation mechanism of Cytolysin A, a bacterial pore-forming toxin
(PFT). One of the key findings of my research this summer studying the
membrane lipid-phase dependent assembly of ClyA using synthetic lipid
vesicles.</p>
<p>I presented my findings in a research seminar on July 15th along with all the
other program participants. You can read my report <a href=https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/intern-diary-15/tree/master/report>report</a> or browse the

<p>The final week turned out to be much more hectic than I had imagined, partly
because of being a victim of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy><em>planning fallacy</em></a>. It is funny how I
grossly underestimated the time it&rsquo;d take to write the report, despite being aware of
the fallacy and actively planning for it (ironic, huh?). The final week saw several rounds of data review,
graph revisions, and extensive literature review to collect relevant and verifiable
references.</p>
<p>After the report submission, but a few days before the live presentation, the
BioEngineering department had arranged a picnic for all the program
participants and their mentors to
<a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Lepakshi,+Andhra+Pradesh+515331/@13.804804,77.6066923,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3bb19833ae8b38c7:0xe42e0f43a3da5ef1?hl=en"><em>Lepakshi</em></a>.
The place was a few hours from Bangalore and home to an old temple. I had a
lot of fun. The picnic also provided a much-needed respite from our busy
summer schedule and an option to bond with other students. At this point, the
thought of creating a presentation was nowhere in my head, as it seemed like
I have a lot of time. However, I don&rsquo;t know what happened or how the time
slipped by, I found myself in a situation where it is 4 pm in the evening and
I have nothing to show the presentation next morning. This is when the
tension started to get to my nerves.</p>
<p>I stayed in the lab until much later that evening. After spending around
three to four hours in the lab, I had a reasonable draft of the presentation and
a transcript to go with it. However, it wasn&rsquo;t until I had sent the slides to
Pradeep and got no corrections back, that I could cozily slip into my bed for
a restful sleep and prepare for the big day.</p>
<p>The next morning, I&rsquo;m cold and nervous. Seven students (my fellow co-interns)
have already presented their work, and it is my turn next. I get up, walk up
to the podium, set my transcript of the desk, and suddenly my mind went
blank. I could not remember anything about the transcript or what I had
written in it.</p>
<p>I paused for a moment and looked at the slides projected on the huge screen
next to me. I read the title in my head and it seemed to relax me a little.
After all, this was a work that I had been deeply involved with for over 2
months now, and by now, I had grown accustomed to those words. I don&rsquo;t
understand what happened next, but this seemed to do the trick. Words started
to flow through me, slide by slide, as I presented everything that I had
prepared. I explained all the figures as I had prepared them, along with my
reasoning for those experiments and what did they mean. Within a few more
minutes, I have finished my presentation and answered all the audience questions
as well.</p>
<p>Later, I was told by Prof. Sandhya that all the professors loved my
presentation. They thought that not only it was good content but also
delivered very professionally. I took a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Overall, everything turned out to better than what I had hoped for. Pradeep
was an excellent mentor, and Prof. Sandhya provided a strong academic role
model to look forward to. As a final cherry on the top, I found out later
during a one-on-one meeting with Prof. Sandhya and she had looked through my
blog (yay shorts!) and really liked it.</p>
<p>With this, it is time to return home. I am not just taking back a report and
certificate from IISc, but a lot of fond memories and inspiring
moments. I have learned to be more curious and enthusiastic about things
around me, observe things closely, and constantly ask <em>Why?</em> I have also learned to
do <em>vertical</em> research, do smart work, interact with peers, build
connections, be independent, and assume humility. These are the
fundamental skills and attitudes that will reflect throughout my life and help
me become a better person and researcher as I try to find my own life path.</p>
<p>Thank you Indian Institute of Science! I&rsquo;ll miss you. I hope our paths will
cross sometime soon.</p>
