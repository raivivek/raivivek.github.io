<cite><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11870085-the-fault-in-our-stars>The Fault in Our Stars</a></cite></footer><blockquote></div><p>Reading is one of the fundamental habits that we learn as a child. Even
before our temporal abilities are decently developed (usually by the end of
third month after birth), people sing songs, lullabies, read stories or make
interesting noises to stimulate our brain. Not much later, reading becomes
out favorite activity where we have already irritated our parents to read
<em>Winnie-the-Pooh</em> over and again for umpteenth time. This habit, however,
grows only up to the teenage years and then starts to diminish, only to
increase again later in
life.<a href=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED496343.pdf>1</a></p><p>A simple Google search yields thousands of blog posts, articles and research
papers discussing the benefits. Although, all of those can be discussed in
much finer details and every point be further analyzed, it suffices to say
that reading is important for personal development and growth of social,
economic and civic life (Holden, 2004); almost as if it a prerequisite for
all cultural and social activities. Not only one becomes a better reader,
writer and self-confident person but also <em>creative</em> by experience other
worlds and newer roles in imagination.</p><div class=epigraph><blockquote><p>Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to
all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire
world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.</p><footer>Albert Einstein</footer><blockquote></div></article><div class=footer><div class=footer-content><div><ul></ul><a href=# class="pure-menu-link pull-right" id=gototop-btn>↑↑</a></div></div></div></body></html>
