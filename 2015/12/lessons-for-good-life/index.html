long term study of adult development done by Harvard and shares his findings
about what made the lives of the participants happy or sad as they aged. While
the talk itself isn&rsquo;t very detailed and offers a <em>too long, didn&rsquo;t read</em> summary, the
publications page<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> on the website offers a comprehensive and has an interesting list of
findings.

happiness</a></span></span></p><p>The main ideas that Robert Waldinger put forward in this talk are:</p><ul><li>Good relations will be the major source of happiness in different stages of
life, specially towards the end.</li><li>Loneliness, though, attractive philosophically, is a <em>killing</em> force.</li><li>Lean towards your social relationships by making intermittent efforts
throughout.</li><li>Good relationships will buffer your from the physical and emotional pain due
to other engagements.</li></ul><p>All these effects were markedly correlated with the changes in the cognitive
ability, mortality and general well-being.</p><p>There is one thing, however, that I would have loved to know. In the beginning,
Robert described two groups of people participating in the study. One group
consisting of students from the Harvard and the other group from poor
neighborhoods of Boston. What differences did he observe in these groups as they
aged? How did the &lsquo;happiness&rsquo; versus &lsquo;age&rsquo; graph of these groups look like? Just
because the latter group had lower expectations, they were happier or could it
be something else?</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=Robert+J.+Waldinger">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=Robert+J.+Waldinger</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p><a href=http://adultdevelopment.wix.com/harvardstudy#!publications/c1xn4>http://adultdevelopment.wix.com/harvardstudy#!publications/c1xn4</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></article><div class=footer><div class=footer-content><div><ul></ul><a href=# class="pure-menu-link pull-right" id=gototop-btn>↑↑</a></div></div></div></body></html>
