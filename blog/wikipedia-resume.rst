It's been a couple of years since I made my first edit on Wikipedia. Over these
years, I have garnered over 1600 [#]_ edits of which most are on
`en.wikipedia.org <https://en.wikiepdia.org>`_. However, as you may notice, my
contribution was highest during the first years and quickly it dwindled to a
handful of rare patrol edits over the next two years. A part of the answer lies
in the fact that I began my undergraduate studies in the same year and ever
since then I could find very less time to edit or create articles.

.. TEASER_END

Nevertheless, I am happy that I have accomplished a good stuff, if not great.
Writing my first article, going through the guidelines, despair when first
crap article is deleted, getting mentored, rolling back vandalism, tagging
articles - all these perfectly document my growth over the years and bring back
exciting (read embarrassing) moments of my learning phase. I learned a lot.

Now that over these years I have acquired knowledge across more domains, my
contributions should be more effective and focused. I plan to write
occasionally in whatever ways I can.

.. [*] My first and hence the most edited article. I was unaware of many Wikipedia editing rules and broke several guidelines (esp. copyright violations). Those portions unfortunately had to be removed. This was also the time when I strongly considered quitting Wiki.
