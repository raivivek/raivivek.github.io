Writing a blog and personalized webpage had been one of primary tasks on my
mind for quite a long time. However, Always I was caught in some acitivity
thereby preventing it to happen. Finally, after lurking through many 
static website generators, I decided to go ahead with the `Nikola`_ and Github
Pages pair as the best combination. Static websites are easy to maintain,
fun, and simply effective for most of my needs. It took some time to get hold
of how these work but in the process I learned about `templating engines`_, 
few javascript libraries and how they are used.

Like all my other projects, the source code for this site is also made 
available on `Github`_. Obviously, whatever I have created is very premature 
and just a working solution. If anyone has anything to say, just drop in an email
or fork the site and send me a pull request. I would be happy to accept constructive
changes. In the meantime, the looks and structure of the site will be subjected to frequent 
modifications.
