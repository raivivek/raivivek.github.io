`Wikipedia <https://wikipedia.org>`_ is one of the largest openly editable, web-based encyclopedias with free
content. Since its inception in 2001 [#]_, it has grown to over 34 million
articles and now attracts 450 million unique visitors amounting to a staggering
20 billion page views per month [#]_. Not to mention that it is
continually reviewed, refined and updated every moment [#]_.

.. TEASER_END

While most of the edits made to Wikipedia are non-registered IP edits [#]_, a
significant portion of the active community is focused on improving particular
sections of the site. People often team up according to their specific topic of
interest, specific location or a specific kind of task and work in an organized
manner. This results in the creation of more accurate, consistent and high-quality
articles that are often promoted to the status of `featured articles
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles>`_ or `good articles
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GA>`_. Currently, there are over `2000
such WikiProjects
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_reports/WikiProjects_by_changes>`_
on English Wikipedia alone with varying level of activity. Naturally, areas
which demand specialization or expertise in a particular field (for example
Mathematics, Biology, Physics) are less active than the ones more accessible to
general public (for example places, monuments, biographies). A complete
directory of already available WikiProjects can be found `here
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Directory>`_.

Initially, when I began contributing articles to Wikipedia, a local and regional
familiarity prompted me to join the `WikiProject India <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_India>`_ and `WikiProject West
Bengal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_West_Bengal>`_ groups. Both of them had a plenty of active and experienced contributors
who would occasionally meet up and organize talks or events of interest. The community is very warm and welcoming to new users
and soon I was invited to one such meetup. Unfortunately, I couldn't attend it
because of college work.

Yesterday while reading an article on Ribonucleic acids on Wikipedia, my mind
veered off for few minutes and came across the WikiProject pages of `Cell and
Molecular Biology
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology>`_
and `Computational Biology
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology>`_.
The portal were neatly organized with significant instructions for a newcomer,
but there was hardly any noticeable recent activity. Being a computational
biology enthusiast myself, I thought this opportunity can readily be used for
learning more about the subject and at the same time contributing more articles
and content to this project. I quickly went through their scope and guidelines
articles and drafted a vague timeline and coverage of my contributions.
However, just then I came across a very interesting section on the homepage
that highlighted an international `article writing competition
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/ISCB_competition_announcement_2014>`_
organized in association with `International Society for Computational Biology
(ISCB) <http://www.iscb.org/>`_.

ISCB article competition
 The competition, running since 2012, awards students
 and trainees for the best contributions to computational biology-related
 articles. Entry is open internationally, to students and trainees of any
 level.
 We particularly encourage lecturers or course organisers to use this competition as a class assignment.

This competition runs through August-January and allows participants to submit
one article within the scope of the project, where they have added or improved
significant content. The results are judged by a committee consisting of experienced Wiki editors, and scientists with
expertise in the related field (for example, `Alex Bateman
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Alexbateman>`_, Head of Protein Sequence
Resources, `EBI <http://ebi.ac.uk/>`_). The best part? A total cash prize of $1000 is awarded to the
winners. What could be better than getting paid for learning!

However, the main goal of this post was not to encourage people to join my
efforts or channel interests specifically towards Computational Biology (I
would be more than happy if it happens). Rather to let others know about such
exciting opportunities present around us all the time, in places where we least expect them to be.
Who knows this was just one of such tons of activities
going on there? Wikipedia is full of mysteries!
