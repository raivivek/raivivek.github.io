Research Experience
===================

B.Tech Thesis, IIT Kharagpur
#############################

`Prof. Amit Kumar Das <http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/fac-profiles/showprofile.php?empcode=aZmXU>`_, **August 2015 - ongoing**

The existence of knots in proteins is an curious event and has aroused interest
in researchers for over a decade. They are rarely found in nature (<1%), and
their folding process is described to be slow and energetically unfavorable.
The knots are not known to perform quite an useful function across all knot
examples, which otherwise cannot be done with an unknotted structure. Despite
significant advancement in our understanding of the underlying mechanism, much
remains elusive to our notebooks. In this study, I set up a two-dimensional
objective to investigate the sequence and structure-related properties of a
protein knot and build upon our previous understanding of the related
questions.

`Prof. Sandya S. Visweswariah <www.mrdg.iisc.ernet.in/sandhyav/index.htm>`_, **May - July 2015**

Extraction, verification and purification of Cytolysin A pore forming toxin of
*E. coli* and its mutant (ClyA Q56C) from expression constructs. Several experiments
for verifying the activity and kinetic efficacy of the toxins were examined
using hemolytic assay and calcein leakage assay. The mutant protein was further
labeled using appropriate fluorescent dye and after assuring activity, was used
for imaging studies.

We also investigated the lipid phase dependent kinetic behavior of Cytolysin A,
and observed that ClyA behaved distinctly in a two component and three
component systems (double exponential versus single exponential curve).

Open Source
===========

`Wikpedia Gender Indicators <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/WIGI:_Wikipedia_Gender_Index>`_
###########################################################################################################

**May 2015 - Present**

WIGI is a project producing a open data set about the gender, date of birth,
place of birth, ethnicity, occupation, and language of biography articles in
all Wikipedias. Our data set comes from Wikidata, the database the feeds
Wikipedia, and is updated weekly. I'm a **co-developer** and **reseracher** on
the project. I have worked on creating interactive analysis graphs using the
data we have collected as a demo, contributed to the research paper
review, and formulation of problem statements for further analysis.

This project started as a `personal research interest
<http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03086>`_ by Maximilian Klein
(`<notconfusing.com>`_), and is now funded by a Wikimedia Foundation Grant.

`SequenceServer <https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenserver>`_
###############################################################

**May 2014 - Present**

SequenceServer allows users to easily set up a **BLAST+ server to be used locally**
or over the web with a nice and intuitive user interface. It is an
elegant alternative to many other similar projects that are often an overkill
or too complex to set up. My important contribution includes (but
not limited to) - :doc:`creating-graphical-overview-with-d3`,
:doc:`understanding-blast-output` and creating the data layer, maintaining code
compatibility with previous versions etc.,

A list of my merged and unmerged changes can be found at
`gh:vivekiitkgp/sequenceserver
<https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/sequenceserver>`_.

`Afra <https://github.com/yeban/afra>`_
#######################################

**Dec 2014 - Jan 2015**

Afra is a **gene annotation platform** inspired by crowdsourcing approaches and
platforms including Foldit, Galaxy Zoo and Crowdflower to recruit additional
gene feature curators.  It aims to simply and provide an easy learning curve so
that even a complicated task like quality gene curation can be performed by
general public.

I have mainly worked with the user interface of the program improving the
overall look and experience. While these changes may seem insignificant in
general, they play a very important role in a client-side heavy application
(such as this one) where user is highly reliant on visual feedback.

A list of my merge commits can be found at `Afra - Contributers
<https://github.com/yeban/afra/commits?author=vivekiitkgp>`_.


Other Projects
==============

MetaKGP
#######

A collaborative effort to promote Wikipedia style open content culture,
collect, curate and archive the unfathomable amount of regularly generated
information in the college.

The efforts of project are live at `MetaKGP <https://wiki.metakgp.org>`_.

Sign Language Interpreter
#########################

**Prof. P. Patnaik, Apr 2014**

* Conceived and designed a gesture to text (or speech) application to interpret
  sign language gestures (non-motion) with a team of 4 people for aiding deaf
  and dumb people;
* Implemented image processing techniques to obtain noise free information from
  real time video; classified data into relevant clusters and predicted unknown
  information using **k-means clustering**;
* Exploring further possibility of providing service through chat applications
  or online widget/web based services.

Jigsaw Puzzle Solver
####################

**Prof. S. K. Barai, March 2014**

* Evaluated different techniques based on **genetic algorithm** to solve large
  piece jigsaw puzzle (randomly shuffled pieces of an image); implemented
  mutation strategies; came up with an approach to use this technique to solve
  images with non unique components;
* Programmed the algorithm entirely from scratch in C++ using OpenCV image
  processing libraries; could solve up to 1000 pieces.

Term Paper
##########

**Comparison of Fuzzy Guided Gene Prediction Methods**

* Reviewed different state-of-art techniques to analyze and annotate whole
  organism genome in an automated way to predict genes and other regions of interest;
* Critiqued the future prospects and application strategies of SVM, NN
  learning with emphasis on heuristic techniques (GA, Fuzzy Logic) as hybrid methods for
  better annotation of raw genomic data.

`gistie <https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/gistie>`_
#################################################

A small script that allows one to quickly create GitHub gists of outputs
received from many terminal commands. Often helpful in scenarios where we want
to create a log of a command output for pasting somewhere or showing to
someone. License and installation instructions are on GitHub page.
