my opinion, a worthy replacement of Make. It is written in
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby&lt;/a> and, as a result,
has the immense benefit of being concise, pleasant to eyes, and fun to write.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vim for Writing</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2016/09/vim-for-writing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2016/09/vim-for-writing/</guid><description>&lt;p>I happen to be a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/Dotfiles-vim">user&lt;/a>—not
because I practice terminal voodoo or intend to push the limits of keyboard
efficiency—because Vim is what I started with and had no reasons to move on. If
you do not find Vim to be a reasonable choice, that is perfectly fine. There
exists a natural equilibrium in the community where users keep keep updating
their preferences as the tools evolve.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open {data, science, source} - OpenSNP.org</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2016/08/open-data-science-source-opensnp.org/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2016/08/open-data-science-source-opensnp.org/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="april-2016">April, 2016&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>“What’s the worst that can happen? Not like it will be different this time.
some sleep”, I told myself as I prepared to brace the bad news. The clock moves
closer to midnight with every passing moment, but I am too tired to think
about it anymore.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quick Data Plotting in R - II</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2016/05/quick-data-plotting-in-r-ii/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2016/05/quick-data-plotting-in-r-ii/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the
&lt;a href="../quickplotting-in-r">first&lt;/a> part
of the posts on R, I outlined a couple of useful strategies for quick
exploratory data analysis and visualization using R programming language. In
this post, I will share a few more examples (in a case-study like manner) along
with relevant plots for better demonstration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quick Data Plotting in R - I</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2016/05/quick-data-plotting-in-r-i/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2016/05/quick-data-plotting-in-r-i/</guid><description>&lt;p>Python is my all time favorite programming language. I use it all the time. It
is simple, readable and easy to get started, something which I picked up four
years ago when I went through the first offering of &lt;em>Interactive Programming
with Python&lt;/em> course on Coursera. Python’s simplicity and appeal has continued to
grow over time, supported by a wide community and a rich environment of
packages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WIGI – an inspire grantee</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2016/05/wigi-an-inspire-grantee/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2016/05/wigi-an-inspire-grantee/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/WIGI:_Wikipedia_Gender_Index">The Wikipedia Indicators of Gender

Whatever be the
use case from the perspective of the institution, it is a nightmare to use for us
students. Most of the standard ports are blocked resulting in SSH difficulties, accessing
&lt;em>ill-fated&lt;/em> websites, or inability to use programs that connect directory to a specific
address or port. Further, not all applications honor the proxy settings further increasing
your frustration, specially if you are a programmer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diving Deeper into BLAST - III</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2014/11/diving-deeper-into-blast-iii/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2014/11/diving-deeper-into-blast-iii/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1763/">BLAST+&lt;/a> is an incredible tool
and does it job in a pretty decent way. However, anyone who has worked
with it for some time with some non trivial details has their own
horror stories to tell. For the past few months where I have been
engaged in development of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenceserver">SequenceServer&lt;/a>, we got
a lot of opportunities to see the ugly inconsistencies buried within an
otherwise beautiful program.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diving Deeper into BLAST - II</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2014/08/diving-deeper-into-blast-ii/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2014/08/diving-deeper-into-blast-ii/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a follow up of the
&lt;a href="https://raivivek.in/code/understanding-blast-output">previous post&lt;/a>
where I was trying to parse the BLAST+ XML output to create an efficient data
layer in SequenceServer. A critical and often demanded feature for the
application was the ability to have a graphical overview of all the obtained
hits. NCBI&amp;rsquo;s BLAST portal, for instance, includes a graphical overview of
your results that summarizes how many hits you got and how do they score.

 However, we had nothing for SequenceServer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diving Deeper into BLAST - I</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2014/07/diving-deeper-into-blast-i/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2014/07/diving-deeper-into-blast-i/</guid><description>&lt;p>In my previous post, I mentioned about a project I was trying to work
on: &lt;a href="http://www.sequenceserver.com">SequenceServer&lt;/a>. Also, in the end I said that I would
be writing about the BLAST algorithm (which is the backbone of this project) and how does
it works so efficiently in producing alignments even with very long sequences. However, In
this post I would like to talk about BLAST program and it's output before we go into the
algorithm some time later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction to Sequenceserver</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2014/05/introduction-to-sequenceserver/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2014/05/introduction-to-sequenceserver/</guid><description>&lt;p>Contributing to open source is quite an exciting journey. I embarked
upon this path recently with few contributions to &lt;a href="http://www.sequenceserver.com/">SequenceServer - A
BLAST tool&lt;/a>, a bioinformatics software
built around BLAST+ that lets you setup a custom BLAST+ server to perform BLAST queries
with your own database locally through a web interface.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
