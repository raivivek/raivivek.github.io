<p>I happen to be a Vim user—not because I practice terminal voodoo or intend to push the limits of keyboard efficiency—because Vim is what I started with and had no reasons to move on.

<p>April, 2016 “What’s the worst that can happen? Not like it will be different this time. some sleep”, I told myself as I prepared to brace the bad news. The clock moves closer to midnight with every passing moment, but I am too tired to think about it anymore.

<p>In the first part of the posts on R, I outlined a couple of useful strategies for quick exploratory data analysis and visualization using R programming language. In this post, I will share a few more examples (in a case-study like manner) along with relevant plots for better demonstration.

<p>Python is my all time favorite programming language. I use it all the time. It is simple, readable and easy to get started, something which I picked up four years ago when I went through the first offering of Interactive Programming with Python course on Coursera.

<p>IIT Kharagpur uses a proxy server to enable outside internet connections. Whatever be the use case from the perspective of the institution, it is a nightmare to use for us students.

<p>BLAST+ is an incredible tool and does it job in a pretty decent way. However, anyone who has worked with it for some time with some non trivial details has their own horror stories to tell.

<p>This is a follow up of the previous post where I was trying to parse the BLAST+ XML output to create an efficient data layer in SequenceServer. A critical and often demanded feature for the application was the ability to have a graphical overview of all the obtained hits.

<p>In my previous post, I mentioned about a project I was trying to work on: SequenceServer. Also, in the end I said that I would be writing about the BLAST algorithm (which is the backbone of this project) and how does it works so efficiently in producing alignments even with very long sequences.

<p>Contributing to open source is quite an exciting journey. I embarked upon this path recently with few contributions to SequenceServer - A BLAST tool, a bioinformatics software built around BLAST+ that lets you setup a custom BLAST+ server to perform BLAST queries with your own database locally through a web interface.
