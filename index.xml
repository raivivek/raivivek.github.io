different aspects of learning (or acquiring) a new skill. He argues that key to
acquiring any new skill requires contribution from two distinct entities in your
brain, which he calls &lt;em>Self-1&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Self-2&lt;/em>. Tennis is simply an example author
uses to put forward his ideas and provide demonstration. More so, because he had
been a tennis coach and a good player himself. The two &lt;em>selves&lt;/em> can loosely be
equated to &lt;em>System 1&lt;/em> and &lt;em>System 2&lt;/em> discussed by Daniel Kahneman in his famous
book &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">&lt;em>Thinking Fast and

&lt;p>From the moment you wake up in the morning till the moment you go to bed, you
are exposed to constant sources of information. Whether it’s your morning

During my research internship at Indian Institute of Science, I had the
opportunity to attend several lecture series by eminent professors, who
introduced us to different fields (e.g., Biomechanics, Systems Biology) and
relevant research they have done in their careers. While all of the lectures
were insightful, one which caught my most attention were those delivered
Dr. Aditya Murthy on neuroscience. His amazing presentation skills, sense of

&lt;p>Reading is one of the fundamental habits that we learn as a child. Even
before our temporal abilities are decently developed (usually by the end of
third month after birth), people sing songs, lullabies, read stories or make
interesting noises to stimulate our brain. Not much later, reading becomes
out favorite activity where we have already irritated our parents to read
&lt;em>Winnie-the-Pooh&lt;/em> over and again for umpteenth time. This habit, however,
grows only up to the teenage years and then starts to diminish, only to
increase again later in

&lt;p>Written by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin
Schrödinger&lt;/a>, an eminent
physicist and Nobel Prize winner, the book &lt;strong>What is Life?&lt;/strong> (&lt;a href="http://whatislife.stanford.edu/LoCo_files/What-is-Life.pdf">get
here&lt;/a>) is an attempt
to understand the aspects of life as manifested by living organisms. As
philosophical it may sound, the author instead endeavors to understand the
organization and behavior of &lt;em>life&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; from individual cells to higher organism,
from the point of a physicist. The book is appealing even to lay readers and
builds on important conceptual constructs of physics without delving too much
into mathematical formulations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diving Deeper into BLAST - III</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2014/11/diving-deeper-into-blast-iii/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2014/11/diving-deeper-into-blast-iii/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1763/">BLAST+&lt;/a> is an incredible tool
and does it job in a pretty decent way. However, anyone who has worked
with it for some time with some non trivial details has their own
horror stories to tell. For the past few months where I have been
engaged in development of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenceserver">SequenceServer&lt;/a>, we got
a lot of opportunities to see the ugly inconsistencies buried within an
otherwise beautiful program.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diving Deeper into BLAST - II</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2014/08/diving-deeper-into-blast-ii/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2014/08/diving-deeper-into-blast-ii/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a follow up of the
&lt;a href="https://raivivek.in/code/understanding-blast-output">previous post&lt;/a>
where I was trying to parse the BLAST+ XML output to create an efficient data
layer in SequenceServer. A critical and often demanded feature for the
application was the ability to have a graphical overview of all the obtained
hits. NCBI&amp;rsquo;s BLAST portal, for instance, includes a graphical overview of
your results that summarizes how many hits you got and how do they score.
&lt;label for="marginnote-0" class="margin-toggle">⊕&lt;/label>
&lt;input type="checkbox" id="marginnote-0" class="margin-toggle">
&lt;span class="marginnote">

&lt;/span>
However, we had nothing for SequenceServer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diving Deeper into BLAST - I</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2014/07/diving-deeper-into-blast-i/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2014/07/diving-deeper-into-blast-i/</guid><description>&lt;p>In my previous post, I mentioned about a project I was trying to work
on: &lt;a href="http://www.sequenceserver.com">SequenceServer&lt;/a>. Also, in the end I said that I would
be writing about the BLAST algorithm (which is the backbone of this project) and how does
it works so efficiently in producing alignments even with very long sequences. However, In
this post I would like to talk about BLAST program and it's output before we go into the
algorithm some time later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction to Sequenceserver</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2014/05/introduction-to-sequenceserver/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2014/05/introduction-to-sequenceserver/</guid><description>&lt;p>Contributing to open source is quite an exciting journey.

upon this path recently with few contributions to &lt;a href="http://www.sequenceserver.com/">SequenceServer - A

built around BLAST+ that lets you setup a custom BLAST+ server to perform BLAST queries
with your own database locally through a web interface.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
