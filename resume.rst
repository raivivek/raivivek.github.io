SequenceServer
##############

`gh:yannickwurm/sequenceserver <https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenserver>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SequenceServer allows users to easily set up a BLAST+ server to be used locally
or over the web with a nice and intuitive user interface. It is an
elegant alternative to many other similar projects that are often an overkill
or too complex to set up. I worked with introducing a number of features and
improvements over the current version. The important contribution includes (but
not limited to) - :doc:`creating-graphical-overview-with-d3`,
:doc:`understanding-blast-output` and creating the data layer, maintaining code
compatibility with previous versions etc.,

A list of my merged and unmerged changes can be found at
`gh:vivekiitkgp/sequenceserver

gistie
######

`gh:vivekiitkgp/gistie <https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/gistie>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------

A small script that allows one to quickly create GitHub gists of outputs
received from many terminal commands. Often helpful in scenarios where we want
to create a log of a command output for pasting somewhere or showing to
someone. License and installation instructions are on GitHub page.
