Open Source
===========

SequenceServer
##############

`gh:yannickwurm/sequenceserver <https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenserver>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SequenceServer allows users to easily set up a BLAST+ server to be used locally
or over the web with a nice and intuitive user interface. It is an
elegant alternative to many other similar projects that are often an overkill
or too complex to set up. I worked with introducing a number of features and
improvements over the current version. The important contribution includes (but
not limited to) - :doc:`creating-graphical-overview-with-d3`,
:doc:`understanding-blast-output` and creating the data layer, maintaining code
compatibility with previous versions etc.,

A list of my merged and unmerged changes can be found at
`gh:vivekiitkgp/sequenceserver

Afra
####

`gh:yeban/afra <https://github.com/yeban/afra>`_
------------------------------------------------
Afra is a gene annotation platform inspired by crowdsourcing approaches and platforms
including Foldit, Galaxy Zoo and Crowdflower to recruit additional gene feature curators.
It aims to simply and provide an easy learning curve so that even a complicated task like
quality gene curation can be performed by general public.

I have mainly worked with the user interface of the program improving the
overall look and experience. While these changes may seem insignificant in
general, they play a very important role in a client-side heavy application
(such as this one) where user is highly reliant on visual feedback.

A list of my merge commits can be found at `Afra - Contributers

gistie
######

`gh:vivekiitkgp/gistie <https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/gistie>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------

A small script that allows one to quickly create GitHub gists of outputs
received from many terminal commands. Often helpful in scenarios where we want
to create a log of a command output for pasting somewhere or showing to
someone. License and installation instructions are on GitHub page.
