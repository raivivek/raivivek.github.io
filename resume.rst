SequenceServer
##############

`gh:yannickwurm/sequenceserver <https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenserver>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SequenceServer allows users to easily set up a BLAST+ server to be used locally
or over the web with a nice and intuitive user inteface. It is a nice and
elegant alternative to many other similar projects that are often an overkill
or too complex to set up. I worked with introducing a number of features and improvements 
over the current version. The important contribution includes (but not limited to) - introducing
a graphical overview using D3, creating a data layer by parsing BLAST XML data, maintaining code 
compatiability with previous versions etc.,

A list of my merged and umerged changes can be found at

gistie
######

`gh:vivekiitkgp/gistie <https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/gistie>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------

A small script that allows one to quickly create Github gists of outputs received from many
terminal commands. Often helpful in scenarios where we want to create a log of a commands' output
for pasting somewhere or showing to someone. License and installation instructions are on Github page.

Term Papers
###########
.. topic:: 1. **Comparison of Fuzzy guided Gene prediction Methods**

    *Guide*: `Prof. S.K. Barai`_

    Mar, 2014

        Technological advancement and next generation techniques are producing more
        genomic data than what could be handled by scientists. This prompts
        development of automatic techniques for understanding and analysis of raw
        genomic data. Prediction of genes is critical for understanding the cell
        regulatory network and hence the human health and medicine.  The paper
        analyzes different fuzzy guided Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network based
        models to predict the genes (on whole genome level in Prokaryotes). In the
        end, future scope of emerging hybrid techniques and some inherent problems
        associated with these methods are discussed.

Applications
############
.. topic:: 1. **Sign Language Interpreter**

  *Co-members*: Palash Mittal, Nevin Valsraj, Anchit Navelkar, Ashutosh Baheti

  *Guide*: `Prof. Priyadarshi Patnaik`_

  Apr, 2014

      We planned to develop a program which would help deaf and dumb people to
      communicate online very easily using simple finger spelled hand gestures.
      It can also be used by normal people as a tutorial software to learn about
      sign language. The approach used was to extract feature vector out of hand
      gestures and then train and classify our model using machine learning.

.. topic::  2. **Jigsaw Puzzle solver**

  *Co-members*: Harsh Gupta, Kumar Agarwal, Shubham Aggarwal, Shubhajoy Das

  Guide: `Prof. S.K. Barai`_

  Mar, 2014

      We developed a large piece jigsaw puzzle solved based on Genetic Algorithm
      technique as a part of Soft Computing Tools in Engineering (CE31501) class of
      SPRING 2014.

.. topic:: 3. **Automated Torn Paper Mosaicing**

  *Co-members*: Anurag Anand, Kumar Agarwal, KGD Rathan, GS Teja

  Mar, 2014

      The application was developed as a part of Intra college competition
      where the target was to come up with novel technique to digitally stitch
      torn paper images and reconstruct the original document. 

  `Code <https://github.com/anuraganand/OpenSoft-2014>`_

.. topic:: 4. **Real Chat**

  *Co-members*: Arkanath Pathak, Sanyam Agarwal

  Oct, 2013

      We developed an interactive chat application on Windows 8 platform for
      Microsoft's code.fun.do appathon. The users will be prompted with
      realtime information based on the natural language processing of their
      chat content, which would help in a having more engaging and informed
      conversation without having to lurk around different webistes and lose
      focus.

.. topic:: 5. **Vim-text**

  *Co-members*: Harsh Gupta

  Yahoo! HackU 2013

  Feb, 2013

      A javascript bookmarket which enabled naive Vim-like editing features for typing in
      text areas across multiple websites. Judged one of the best entry among first year 
      participating teams.
