The inflow of\ninformation is too rapid and too vast to be contained and sufficiency conveyed\nto the target audience, thus necessitating the need of specialized sources.</p>\n<p>Research papers act as such specialized source and focus clearly on a topic,\nexpress rigorous discussions, distinguishes between reliable and biased\nsources, between authoritative and questionable statistics, and between fact\nand opinion. Peer reviewed journals take this even further by ensuring that\nsubmitted articles always meet a certain quality and standard criteria. It is\none of the reasons that journals like <a href="https://nature.com">nature</a>,\n<a href="https://sciencemag.com">science</a> are highly acclaimed.</p>\n<p>Although, reading research papers often requires effort mostly because of\nhighly condensed information and intended audience, but they provide a great\ninsight into the design and thought process. They help you picture the whole\nsetup and perform each and every step mentally (even reproduce in your lab!)\nand understand the big picture.</p>\n<p>Consequently, in an effort to align my research interests and expand knowledge\npool, I have started an initiative to try reading at least two papers a week.\nThese papers will be selected based on my interest area, its popularity and\nfaculty recommendations. Also, to ensure that I\'m just not skimming through\nthe content but trying to understand it, I\'ll try writing an one page review\naccording to a fixed template. Following this template should ensure that I do\na critical and creative thinking of the paper.</p>\n<p>You can find a list of all the papers I have read along with the one page\nreviews at\n<a href="https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/papers-per-week"><strong>papers-per-week</strong></a>.

The reluctance to fund\nacademia and research, in turn, comes from a completely skewed perception by\nthe public of what academia is supposed to accomplish -- which in no small part\ncomes from the capitalist marketplace thinking that permeates almost everything\nour society does.</p>\n<p><em>Marketplace thinking fails to capture the value of academia because most of\nthe benefits of academia do not carry a direct, quantifiable, financial gain.</em></p>\n<p>A college education is now viewed as a means to a purely financial end, rather\nthan something with inherent value both to the individual receiving it and the\nsociety of which that individual is a member. Quite simply, people are being\ntrained to look at a degree as a way to get a job; the chief way of determining\nwhether or not a college education is worth it is to perform a <em>shudder</em>\nfinancial return on investment calculation and pretty much ignore all of the\nother benefits that a college education confers.</p>\n<p>If that\'s the way an education is to be perceived, its costs will go up while\nits quality goes down. Administrators will seek to remove every part of the\nexperience that doesn\'t contribute to making someone more employable (goodbye\nliberal arts education!) while simultaneously delivering the "essential" parts\nas cheaply as possible (hello adjuncts!). All the while, prices will go up to\nreflect the (ick) "increased earning potential" of graduates.</p>\n<p>Research suffers for similar reasons -- the public is being trained to demand a\nfinancial return on a financial investment, but that\'s simply not the way\nresearch works. Most research will produce very little practical knowledge that\nleaks out into the real world in the form of products or technologies; the\nhandful of projects that do literally transform how we live and think. The\nproblem is that we can\'t identify which projects will be which before we\nactually commit, so we\'ve got to do a lot of them with the knowledge that most\nwon\'t yield much. This kind of thinking is total anathema to the market because\neveryone expects returns on each individual project!</p>\n<p>This will never get fixed unless the public\'s perceptions of what education and\nresearch are for are dramatically changed. We all need to stop thinking so\ndamned much about money (specifically, accumulating obscene amounts of it) and\nstart focusing on a more abstract definition of quality of life. There needs to\nbe a new framework for evaluating the value of things and activities that\ndoesn\'t simply fall back on a bottom line calculation. This is going to be a\nglacial shift in thinking, but it\'s the only long-game I can come up with\nthat\'s going to allow academia to reach its potential.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(via\n<a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-biggest-obstacle-in-reforming-academia-today/answer/Brian-Farley-3">Quora</a>)</p>', 'url': u'science/research-needs-funding.html', 'max_subpages': None, 'template': 'post.haml', 'sort_reverse': True, 'date': datetime.datetime(2015, 4, 16, 0, 0), 'title': 'research needs funding', 'slug': u'research-needs-funding'}, {'category': 'unfinished', 'index': False, 'subpages': [], 'target': u'unfinished/reading-habit.html', 'author': 'Vivek Rai', 'sort_key': None, 'checksum': '\xc7-\x8d\x1e\x1a\xa4\xbf\xe4\xeeA\x00\x16\xb8"\x8d\\', 'rel_site_url': '..', 'excerpt': u'Why reading is one thing that can change your life.\n', 'modified': 1429183975.342375, 'filename': '/home/vivekrai/my_coding/shorts/content/unfinished/reading-habit.mkd', 'content': u'<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cAs he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.\u201d\n\u2015 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1406384.John_Green">John Green</a>,\n<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11870085-the-fault-in-our-stars">The Fault in Our\nStars</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reading is one of the fundamental habits that we learn as a child. Even before our\ntemporal abilities are decently developed (usually by the end of third month\nafter birth), people sing songs, lullabies, read stories or make interesting noises\nto stimulate our brain. Not much later, reading becomes out favorite activity where\nwe have already irritated our parents to read <em>Winnie-the-Pooh</em> over and again\nfor umpteenth time. This habit, however, grows only up to the teenage years and\nthen starts to diminish, only to increase again later in life.<a href="http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED496343.pdf">1</a></p>\n<p>A simple Google search yields thousands of blog posts, articles and research\npapers discussing the benefits. Although, all of those can be discussed in much\nfiner details and every point be further analyzed, it suffices to say that reading\nis important for personal development and growth of social, economic and civic\nlife (Holden, 2004); almost as if it a prerequisite for all cultural and social\nactivities.
