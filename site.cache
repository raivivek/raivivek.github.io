Please feel free to disagree or\nimprove.</small></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Content</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do not dump a large amount of content on a single slide. Cluttered slides look\nbad. Use figures, a few bullet points or lines, legible font.</li>\n<li>For short talks (10-15 min), no more than 10-12 slides. The general rule of\nthumb could be to have 1-2 min per slide. Prefer to sacrifice content over\nclarity in tight situations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Body Language</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get a feedback of your on-stage body language from your friends. Minimize any\ndistracting gestures.\nFor example, racing impatiently across the stage as if it\u2019s on fire.</li>\n<li>Presentation is a two way communication with the audience. To do this, <em>make\neye-contact</em> with the audience and keep them engaged. Don&#8217;t bury yourself in your slides.</li>\n<li>Prefer to walk across the stage (or available area) once in a while to ensure\nconnectivity with the whole audience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Preparation</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is wise to outline a rough transcript of what you are going to say and\nmemorize some key sentences that introduce critical slides.</li>\n<li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2014/03/17/the-one-habit-that-brilliant-ted-speakers-practice-up-to-200-times/">Practice</a>.\nAnd not just a little practice, but many, many hours of it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Talk</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Prefer not to begin with, <em>"The title of my talk is foo bar"</em>.</li>\n<li>Do not read the content verbatim from the slides.</li>\n<li>Talk slowly and clearly at the audience. If you feel you&#8217;re speaking too slowly, you&#8217;re speaking at about the right speed.[4]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Taking Questions</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Maintain a calm, composed body language. Make eye contact with the questioner\nas you hear the complete question.</li>\n<li>Repeating and rephrasing (if needed) the questions is a good strategy. Ask\nthe questioner if you have understood it properly and then proceed to answer\nit.</li>\n<li>It is good to say, &#8220;<em>I don&#8217;t know</em>&#8221;, &#8220;<em>I didn&#8217;t think this before</em>&#8221;, &#8220;<em>Let&#8217;s talk\nabout it after the lecture</em>&#8221;, or &#8220;<em>That is very important criticism.</em>&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><small> Many points are taken from these excellent resources:</small></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Alon, U.

Lessons from the longest study on\nhappiness</a></p>\n\n<p>Robert Waldinger,[1] a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School talks about a famous\nlong term study of adult development done by Harvard and shares his findings\nabout what made the lives of the participants happy or sad as they aged. While\nthe talk itself isn&#8217;t very detailed and offers a <em>too long, didn&#8217;t read</em> summary\n(quite typical of a TED talk, probably one of the important reasons to hate it\nif you are critical), the publications page[2] on the website offers\na comprehensive and interesting list of findings.</p>\n\n<p>The main ideas that he put forward in this talk:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Good relations will be the major source of happiness in different stages of\nlife, specially towards the end.</li>\n<li>Loneliness, though, attractive philosophically, is a <em>killing</em> force.</li>\n<li>Lean towards your social relationships by making intermittent efforts\nthroughout.</li>\n<li>Good relationships will buffer your from the physical and emotional pain due\nto other engagements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All these effects were markedly correlated with the changes in the cognitive\nability, mortality and general well-being.</p>\n\n<p>There is one thing, however, that I would have loved to know. In the beginning,\nRobert described two groups of people participating in the study. One group\nconsisting of students from the Harvard and the other group from poor\nneighborhoods of Boston. What differences did he observe in these groups as they\naged? How did the &#8216;happiness&#8217; versus &#8216;age&#8217; graph of these groups look like? Just\nbecause the latter group had lower expectations, they were happier or could it\nbe something else?</p>\n', 'max_subpages': None, 'template': 'post.haml', 'sort_reverse': True}, {'subpages': [], 'hover': 'Pinned Post', 'author': 'Vivek Rai', 'sort_key': None, 'excerpt': u'Books are magic.\n', 'date': datetime.datetime(2017, 7, 9, 0, 0), 'slug': u'list-of-books', 'category': 'books', 'index': False, 'target': u'books/list-of-books.html', 'title': 'List of books I have read', 'url': u'books/list-of-books.html', 'checksum': '\x99)@\xba\xe2LW\xc3\x00P\xdd\xd81E\x82\x04', 'rel_site_url': '..', 'modified': 1499614962.219742, 'filename': '/home/vivekrai/src/shorts/content/books/list-of-books.mkd', 'content': u'<p><small>[*] currently reading, [+] recommended, [-] annoying</small></p>\n\n<h3>2017</h3>\n\n<p>Challenge: <strong>40</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bloom, Paul &#8216;How Pleasure Works&#8217;</li>\n<li><strong>+</strong> MacAskill, William &#8216;Doing Good Better&#8217;</li>\n<li>Mistry, Rohinton &#8216;Family Matters&#8217;</li>\n<li><strong>+</strong> Gowers, Timothy &#8216;Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction&#8217;</li>\n<li><strong>+</strong> Eco, Umberto &#8216;How to Write a Thesis&#8217;\n<blockquote> <small> As a continuing graduate student, I found the suggestions put forward\nby the author extremely helpful.

He argues that key to\nacquiring any new skill requires contribution from two distinct entities in your\nbrain, which he calls <em>Self-1</em> and <em>Self-2</em>. Tennis is simply an example author\nuses to put forward his ideas and provide demonstration. More so, because he had\nbeen a tennis coach and a good player himself. The two <em>selves</em> can loosely be\nequated to <em>System 1</em> and <em>System 2</em> discussed by Daniel Kahneman in his famous\nbook <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow"><em>Thinking Fast and\nSlow</em></a>. I strongly\nrecommend the latter if you haven\u2019t read it yet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR; Watch <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUdTxXkecr8">this</a> video.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I liked the writing and found the author quite agreeable most of the times.\nPerhaps because he did not attempt to make his descriptions appear scientific\nand novel by supporting with hasty references. Instead, he chose to start with\na fundamental premise that continues through the ten chapters of the book, and\nsupports his ideas based on his personal experience as a learner and coach.</p>\n\n<p>Timothy says that a player when learning a skill or playing a game are actually\nplaying two games. First, she is quite visibly trying to learn or do good in the\ngame by following instructions given by the coach. Second, she is playing an\n\u2018inner game\u2019 which exists in her mind between the two \u2018selves\u2019. The \u2018Self 1\u2019\nwhich is the calculative, judgemental part which is actively trying to execute\nthe instructions, judge performance, and \u2018trying hard\u2019 to make it better. The\nother \u2018Self 2\u2019 which is a detached observer of the game and is making the most\nnatural moves to accomplish the task hand, i.e., reach out to the ball and hit\nit. It is the tussle or the nature of relationship between the two that\ndetermines one\u2019s ability to translate knowledge into effective action.</p>\n\n<p>The author then devotes further chapters to describe the relationship between\nthe two and how it can be refined for better learning. The suggested strategies\nare handful, and I have tried to list a few of them below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Let go of judgements. Judgement provokes thinking process and initiates the\nprocessing of \u2018fixing\u2019 things (if they are going wrong) or doing it right\nrepeatedly (if they are going right). Observe and absorb events are they\nare, simply <em>acknowledge</em>. Positive thinking or compliments are also\njudgement in disguise.</li>\n<li>Trust your natural learning process. It is doing well to learn you the\nnecessary skills. Let is observe games, observe the events of the game. It\nwill auto correct itself as you try to imagine the \u2018correct\u2019 way to do\nthings. Do not force yourself.</li>\n<li>Showing is better than telling. And in case you are provided instructions, use\nthem as a guide to achieve a particular end rather than following verbatim.</li>\n<li>Fighting the mind to make a change does not work. What works best is learning\nto focus it. It involves tricks like trying to watch the seam of the ball or\nsaying bounce-hit as the ball bounces across the court and let the \u2018Self 2\u2019\nhandle the game.</li>\n<li>Watch \u2018other\u2019 games you play. For example, whether you are playing the game to\nperfect yourself, for fun, to compete or simply to make friends. <strong>You are\nnot the game you play. Your self-worth is not determined by the game you\nplay.</strong> Ask yourself, \u2018What do you really want from the game?\u2019.</li>\n<li>Give up the attachment with your game with respect to motives and ultimate\ntargets. Enjoy the game. </li>\n<li>Competition is about making yourself better. Competition is about having\na challenging opponent who brings out the best in you. Embrace competition\nas a natural process of learning.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the book. It does feel repetitive at times but given\nthat it\u2019s a short book (~130 pages), I strongly recommend it. </p>\n', 'max_subpages': None, 'template': 'post.haml', 'sort_reverse': True}, {'subpages': [], 'author': 'Vivek Rai', 'sort_key': None, 'excerpt': u'Orwell\u2019s second book, his life in Burma\n', 'date': datetime.datetime(2016, 2, 18, 0, 0), 'slug': u'burmese-days', 'category': 'books', 'index': False, 'target': u'books/burmese-days.html', 'title': 'Review: Burmese Days', 'url': u'books/burmese-days.html', 'checksum': '\xd6\x9b\xcedN\xea\x8b\\5\x07\x10\xd993V\x9c', 'rel_site_url': '..', 'modified': 1455605779.44466, 'filename': '/home/vivekrai/src/shorts/content/books/burmese-days.mkd', 'content': u'<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cIt is one of the tragedies of the half-educated that they develop late, when they are already committed to some wrong way of life.\u201d\n  \u2015 George Orwell, Burmese Days </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1072932.Burmese_Days&#8221; style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"><img border="0&#8221; alt="Burmese Days&#8221; src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1360566162m/1072932.jpg&#8221; /></a><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1072932.Burmese_Days">Burmese Days</a> by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3706.George_Orwell">George Orwell</a><br/>\nMy rating: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1544925544">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />\nReading <em>Burmese Days</em> after 1984, indeed allows one to comprehend the maturity of Orwell&#8217;s writing he showed in his later works.<br><br>Pages after pages, almost until half way through the book, Burmese Days is nothing but a good, detailed description of what&#8217;s the life of an Englishman in Burma (during 1900s).

In\nthis post, I will share a few more examples (in a case-study like manner) along\nwith relevant plots for better demonstration.</p>\n\n<h4>Getting rid of artificial patterns</h4>\n\n<p>Plotting a graph where one or more attributes have identical values results in\na graph which looks stratified. Closely spaced points with similar values tend\nto fall along a line and create artificial patterns. Consider for example,\nthe plot shown below where Y-axis has many identical values.</p>\n\n<figure style="text-align:center">\n<img\n    src="/images/non_random.png"\n    title="Boxplot demo"\n    style="width: 90%; height: auto"/>\n<figcaption>\nA stratified appearance of a non-random repeated data.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>This artifact looks bad and hides the appearance of the data. It is difficult to\nfigure out which regions are denser or sparser than the others. To get rid of it,\nwe add a small random noise independently to the axes which have many identical\nvalues and contribute to the artifact. It will cause the values to shift\nsufficiently enough to appear dispersed without influencing your analyses (since\nthere perturbations are random).</p>\n\n<div class="codehilite"><pre><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> dy <span class="o">&lt;-</span> runif<span class="p">(</span><span class="kp">length</span><span class="p">(</span>y<span class="p">))</span>\n<span class="o">&gt;</span> plot<span class="p">(</span>x<span class="p">,</span> y<span class="o">+</span>dy<span class="p">)</span>\n\n<span class="c1"># in case plotting two independent variables</span>\n<span class="o">&gt;</span> dx <span class="o">&lt;-</span> runif<span class="p">(</span><span class="kp">length</span><span class="p">(</span>x<span class="p">))</span>\n<span class="o">&gt;</span> plot<span class="p">(</span>x<span class="o">+</span>dx<span class="p">,</span> y<span class="o">+</span>dy<span class="p">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The result:</p>\n\n<figure style="text-align:center">\n<img\n    src="/images/dy_nonrandom.png"\n    title="Noise addition demo"\n    style="width: 125%; margin: 0 -12.5%"/>\n<figcaption>\nSame as previous except with additional random noise.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h4>Transparency helps</h4>\n\n<p>If we have a large number of data points, our scatter plot can easily become\na blob despite using <code>pch=\'.\'</code>. A good idea in those cases is to color the\npoints with a level of transparency. This allows the regions of the plot with\ndense cluster of points to show up as dark regions when compared to less dense\nregions.

This post\nis also a personal account of my experiences besides being a suitably technical\nintroduction to my project.</p>\n\n<p>So, by the end of this post, I hope to provide everyone with a clear idea of what\nI have been working on and why it matters, describe my progress on the project,\nand share the marvelous experience of working with the OpenSNP team.</p>\n\n<h3>Project</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n<small>\nCurrently, OpenSNP portal has a decent database collection of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype">genotypes</a> (3000+\nusers), <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype">phenotypes</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"\nhref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism">SNPs</a> and\nassociated literature information all available in an easily searchable way.\nThere is, however, a lot of scope in improving the impact and reach of the\nproject by modernizing the interface, studying the aggregated data, and\nproviding intuitive analysis to the users to allow for quicker yet improved and\ncomprehensive understanding. For example, OpenSNP portal currently displays the\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele">allele</a> frequency of\na genotype - a valuable insight into how rare your mutation is.\n\n<p></p>\nThis proposal seeks to work on the second problem of bridging different\ncomponents to allow for better interactivity and information conveyance.\n\n<footer>\n<cite>\n\u2014 (<a href="">Original proposal</a>, revised)\n</cite>\n</footer>\n</small>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In line with the proposition set up in the introduction, my project aims to\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/openSNP/snpr/blob/master/ROADMAP.md#long-term-6-months">Link the SNPs with\nPhenotypes in the\nportal</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>What do I mean by linking?</em></p>\n\n<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism">SNPs</a> (pronounced\n<em>snips</em>), simply, are single nucleotide variations in DNA that occur with\na certain percentage of a population.<sup id="a1"><a href="#id1">1</a></sup> They can\naffect how humans develop diseases and respond to pathogens, chemicals, drugs,\nvaccines, and other agents. A set of SNPs for a single individual can also act\nas a unique signature useful in identification and forensics. Naturally,\nfiguring out the possible downstream effects of an SNP is indeed useful. And\nthat\u2019s exactly what we mean by linking SNPs to phenotypes.<sup\nid="a2"><a href="#id2">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>However, a word of caution here. Figuring out the <em>causal</em> effects of\na particular SNP is a tricky task with significant computational and\nexperimental challenges, enough to be a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study">widely\nstudied</a> biological\nproblem. <em>We couldn\u2019t be doing the original research here, are we?</em> Well, no.\nInstead, we are going to use the research data that has already been generated\nand available to us as valuable references \u2014 through secondary analysis using\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining">text mining</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Motivation</h3>\n\n<figure style="text-align:center;">\n  <img src="/images/opensnp.png" width="60%">  </img>\n  <figcaption>\n    (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/openSNP/Community-Design/tree/master/openSNP/RGB">Source</a>)\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://opensnp.org">OpenSNP.org</a> has a single purpose \u2014  to act as a free,\nopen-data repository by collecting personal genomics data into the public\ndomain. The web-portal, thus, is the critical component of the infrastructure.\nFrom my understanding, I can imagine two immediate benefits of this project.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the overall user-experience by making to easier to understand possible\nassociations between an SNP to a phenotype and vice-versa.</li>\n<li>Build a semantic data structure (or network) of SNPs and Phenotypes linked\nbased on literature information.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Although the second point is not the obvious goal of this project, I believe it\ncould potentially serve as a useful data source to openSNP users in future.</p>\n\n<h3>Progress</h3>\n\n<p>The main components of the project were: (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/snpr/commits/master">commits on GitHub</a>)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Schema updates, database model, building association table - \u2713</li>\n<li>Updating the controllers and views - \u2713</li>\n<li>Algorithm to search and score literature for phenotypes - \u2713, <em>v1.0</em></li>\n<li>Writing the worker script - \u2713</li>\n<li>Writing tests for everything above - <em>in progress</em></li>\n<li>Executing Rake tasks - <em>later</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the first step, I familiarized myself with Rails and ActiveRecord pattern before\nmoving to database associations. A useful strategy to learn fast was to set up\ndummy examples. For example, using <code>rails console</code>, one could examine arbitrary\nobjects, query database, or modify objects. It became super easy to understand\nconcepts like foreign key, indexing, migration and debug errors. Through this,\nI could learn how pieces of code come together to create a coherent\narchitecture, like the MVC pattern.  \u2014  exciting start!</p>\n\n<p>Next step was to write code to score phenotype matches across the references\ncorresponding to each SNP and rank the possible matches. The first strategy was\nto try a simple frequency lookup. While this sounds easy and attractive\noption, it is a <em>naive</em> solution, and there are some serious limitations\nto it. For instance:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>OpenSNP\u2019s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://opensnp.org/phenotypes">phenotypes table</a> is populated manually by users. The added phenotypes\noften do no correspond to the phenotypes as reported in references. Hence,\nthere will be no match.</li>\n<li>Since we are not searching through the full text of the references but only through\ntitle and summary (for some papers, if available), it creates an issue\nsince many references do not name a phenotype in the title to avoid coming as too\nstrong when studies are only suggestive.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All in all, you end up with too few phenotypes detected for a single SNP even\nthough it has tons of references. We discussed this and thought of several\nideas - use additional data aggregation tools (for example,\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://myvariant.info">myvariant.info</a>), use a standard list of phenotypes, or\neven <em>better</em> create a phenotype network and leverage phenotype associations.</p>\n\n<figure style="text-align:center;">\n  <img src="/images/pheno_list.png" width="100%">  </img>\n  <figcaption>\n    The SNP info dashboard showing current columns of genotype and allele\n    frequency along with newly implemented (for demo purposes!) list of\n    suggestive phenotypes.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>However, for the sake of simplicity and as a first milestone, we proceeded with the\ninitial naive approach hoping to improve it in future iterations. The final\nlogic was packed into a <code>Sidekiq</code> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/snpr/blob/master/app/workers/link_snp_phenotype.rb">worker\nscript</a>\n\u2014  so far so good.</p>\n\n<p>The next critical task was to write extensive unit tests and document all of the\nimplemented changes. This is what I have been mainly doing in the last\nfew weeks of the project. In the remaining time, I hope to continue testing and\nimproving on the worker script. I obtained an actual data dump from the\nproduction database that I can use actually to check and see the performance.\nEspecially because it\u2019s a per SNP operation and there are thousands of it. So, it\nwould be crucial to see how much additional overhead it adds to the production\nserver.</p>\n\n<p>Besides, during this process, I came across several aspects of the code that could be\nimproved. For example, Phenotype table did not have a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/openSNP/snpr/issues/304">unique key\nconstraint</a> on the <code>characteristic</code>\ncolumn. So, you could have two (or more!) rows describing <em>hair color</em> or\n<em>height</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I would not say that I delivered entirely on each deliverable, but we\ndefinitely moved in a forward direction. Several new challenges came up, but\nwe hope to continue working on their resolution - after and beyond the scope of GSoC.</p>\n\n<h3>Journey</h3>\n\n<p>I cannot thank my mentors enough for their continuous effort throughout the\nproject. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/PhilippBayer">Philipp</a> and\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/gedankenstuecke">Bastian</a> are one of the most enthusiastic\nand voracious readers I have met so far.

There\nexists a natural equilibrium in the community where users keep keep updating\ntheir preferences as the tools evolve.</p>\n\n<p>Over years, I have spent countless hours learning my editor environment and\ncustomizing it to my needs. It was not an easy task, and to to some extent,\njustified the funny <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thejach.com/imgs/vim_learning.jpg">learning curves of classical text\neditors</a>. Nonetheless, With time\nVim went beyond an excellent code editor and developed into my primary writing tool for composing\nemails, editing and proof-reading drafts, and writing thesis. Naturally, some configurations adopted\nfor code-heavy environment demanded a revisit.</p>\n\n<p>However, one of the good aspects of Vim is its extreme level of customizability. Vim can\nbe extended much beyond its &#8217;out of the box&#8217; abilities by writing plugins in\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimscript">Vimscript</a> \u2014 a programming language\nwritten specifically for Vim. Since programmers like to configure and adapt\ntheir tools to their programming environment and experience, over thousands of\nplugins have been written and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://vim-scripts.org/">made available</a> for Vim.\nFor example, plugins to add advanced auto-completion plugins, fuzzy-file\nsearches, improved code search and navigation, custom shortcuts, and quick\ncompile or debug tools. However, let&#8217;s say this for record, you do not need to\nknow Vimscript to use Vim and neither it is one of the most friendly languages\nto learn.</p>\n\n<p>An important component of this experience is a set of plugins I added to my\nconfiguration, allowing me to observe typos, spelling mistakes, auto-correct\nminor errors, and even perform an advanced thesaurus lookup. If you are\ninterested in such a setup for your Vim, this post might be useful.</p>\n\n<h2>Plugins</h2>\n\n<p>I used the following plugins \u2014  most of them are by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/reedes/">reedes</a>:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/reedes/vim-pencil">vim-pencil</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>The pencil plugin aspires to make Vim as powerful a tool for writers as it is\nfor coders by focusing narrowly on the handful of tweaks needed to smooth the\npath to writing prose.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/reedes/vim-wordy">vim-wordy</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Highlights weak patterns of writing, for example, weasel words, jargon, opinion,\nredundant words, similies.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/reedes/vim-ditto">vim-ditto</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Highlights repeated use of a phrase of word in your text.

If you too, are wondering as I did, about all\nthis fuss and what does it mean to have your website respond, then I hope that this\nshort can provide you an initial understanding of concepts.</p>\n\n<p>With an increasing fraction of public connecting to Internet and accessing\ncontent through their mobile devices, it has become necessary to design your website&#8217;s\ninterface keeping in mind proper layout and display across most of these\ndevices (if not all).

But before I talk about my experience of the\nconference (and amazing Disney World!), let me roll back a bit and tell you\nabout why I was there.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=&#8217;ISMB2016&#8217; height="35%&#8221; width="45%&#8221;\nsrc="//www.iscb.org/images/stories/ismb2016/downloads/ISMB2016_vertical.jpeg"></p>\n\n<h3>ISCB Competition</h3>\n\n<p>Several months ago, I wrote a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="wikiproject-submission.html"><em>short</em></a> describing my submission for ISCB\nWikipedia article writing competition. For those who don\u2019t know, the competition\ninvited people to improve upon existing computational biology articles on\nWikipedia by adding or improving upon existing resources. The simple\naim of the initiative was to propagate the idea of open-science and\nopen-research, and to encourage collective community efforts for knowlege\ncuration.</p>\n\n<p>So, after the official editing period finished in January, I got busy in other\ncollege activities and nearly forgot about it until one day in June when\nI received an email from <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bateman">Alex\nBateman</a>. He let me know, much to my\nsuprise and joy, that my contributions were judged in top 3 by the review\ncommittee, and whether I would like to come to ISMB 2016 and receive the award\nin person if possible. He also generously agreed to partially sponsor my travel\nand accommodation for the conference!</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks later, I was walking through the meandering hallways of the\nconference venue, the wonderful Disney World resort, marveling at the sheer\nscale of the conference\u2014thousands of people from all over the world,\nenthusiastically swarming around conference halls and ball rooms.</p>\n\n<h3>BOSC, ISMB and Dinner!</h3>\n\n<p>Since I went a day before the main conference was scheduled to start, I could\nattend a half day session of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust">BOSC</a>, a special interest group meeting, organized\ntwo days before ISMB. Bastian Greshake, founder of OpenSNP and also my mentor\nfor Google Summer of Code project, gave a talk about latest developments with\nthe project. It was a fun experience to see my name feature twice on\npresentations as a Google Summer of Code student for OBF and OpenSNP. In the\nevening, I joined about 20 other people including <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/">Peter\nCock</a> (lead\ndeveloper of BioPython), <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/sjackman">Shaun Jackman</a> (developer\nof LinuxBrew), <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://ruleofthirds.de/">Bastian Greshake</a> (founder of\nOpenSNP.org), and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www2.lbl.gov/msd/people/investigators.html">Nomi\nHarris</a> (co-chair of BOSC\n\u201817) for a dinner in Orlando city.</p>\n\n<p>The main ISMB conference started from next day. It was, however, a struggle to\nwake up at 9 am in the morning while I was still jetlagged. As a result,\nI missed the morning keynotes for consecutive two days. Furthermore, it was\nreally hard to decide which talks to attend since I did not know many of the\nspeakers. I followed the talk descriptions and went to the ones I liked\u2014mostly\nrelated to challenges of machine learning and big-data in Biology. Later that\nday,\nI met with Alex Bateman and we discussed about organizing the Wikipedia\neditathon the next day. He also introduced me to Alastair K., a post-doctoral\nstudent at UCSD and also one of the former winner of the ISCB competition.</p>\n\n<p>\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/ISMB_2016_Editathon">\n  <img\n    alt="Wiki editathon ISMB 2016.jpg" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Wiki_editathon_ISMB_2016.jpg"\n    height="60%"\n    width="90%">\n</a>\n</p>\n\n<p>Since I didn&#8217;t explore much of area around Disney resort the previous day,\nI used the rest of my evening to enjoy the atmosphere and explore dinner\noptions. Finding food, however, turned out to be a real struggle. Unless you can\nlive on french fries and coke, or are ready to burn holes in your wallet (not\na problem if your expenses are reimbursed), moving around and relying on Disney\nWorld eateries is best to be avoided. Guess which one I did?</p>\n\n<p>zzz&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>Next morning, I met Alex and Alastair again. We reviewed the presentation and\na general workflow of the editathon to be organized later that evening. Alex also\nintroduced me to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Teichmann">Sarah Teichmann</a>, Head of Cellular Genetics at the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust">Wellcome\nTrust Sanger Institute</a>, one of\nthe keynote speakers of the conference. For the rest of the day, I spent time\nwalking around the posters and listening to the presentors. It was quite\na coincidence when I run into Johannes Koster, one of the lead contributors to\nBioconda project. He was quick to recognize my name since I had made several\ncontributions to the repository. It&#8217;s surprising how small the world can be\nsometimes. There were also a couple of\nfunny instances when people mistook me for a graduate student.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of it, however, I felt overwhelmed and slighty sad too. I felt like\nI am missing something.</p>\n\n<p class="side-card go-left">\nISMB Wikipedia Editathon 2016\n</p>\n\n<p>After the poster session was over, we conducted the editathon as planned. Alex\nled the editing session with a few demonstrations done by Alastair, while I was\navailable as an assistant if someone faced any issues. We attracted a moderate\ncrowd (~20 people) of interesting people. The important takeaway lessons from\nthe workshop are documented <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/ISMB_2016_Editathon">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Later that night, I spent some time walking around the beautiful decks of the\nresort area, ruminating over the overwhelming thought I had earlier. It was an\nunbelievingly beautiful night. Occasional fireworks washed the sky with colors\noften shadowing the vibrant brightness of lights that decorated the decks.\nChildren enjoyed night performances by several artists, while adults paused to\nspare a few intermittent laughs. That\u2019s when I understood the true nature of my\nemotional uneasiness.</p>\n\n<p class="side-card go-left">\nMixed feelings\n</p>\n\n<p>I was not sad, scared or intimidated because of the scale of the conference and\nscience involved. I was sad because I too wanted to be a part of that community.\nThe event triggered a deep seated longing in my heart, the satisfaction of\nworking on your passion and proudly presenting it to the world\u2014for all the\naccolades and criticism it has to offer. I felt a deep sense of understanding as\nI walked back to my room to get some sleep and prepare for the final day of the\nconference.</p>\n\n<p>Next day, also the final day of the conference, I hopped through some sponsor\nexhibits and collected a few tee-shirts and goodies. Finally, my excitement\nsurged to its peak when the awards ceremony began as the culminating element of\nthe conference.</p>\n\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">\nIt was an exciting experience to be up there on stage!

I will\nrefrain from providing a context at the moment as it may act as a\nprimer.\n\nI have grown through years in close unison with areas of computer\nscience, where there is a tradition of publishing ideas in conferences\nand doing things in open aka open-source way. This ideology has\ninfluenced me a lot, and I have striven to appropriately license my\nwork in a manner that allows maximum reuse and persistence even if the\nwork has just started. However, I realize that this tradition is far\nfrom true in domains like biology. There is an invisible force pushing\nfor secrecy, patents, rights protection, publish-or-perish. People\nwant to preserve ideas first at any cost, irrespective of whether\nthey'll ever work on that idea or not. I guess most of these arise to\ninternal competition on funding and other resources. But anyway.\n\nI wish to know your ideas on ethics and ways of doing science,\nespecially in the context of topics above.

The reluctance to fund\n  academia and research, in turn, comes from a completely skewed perception by\n  the public of what academia is supposed to accomplish &#8211; which in no small part\n  comes from the capitalist marketplace thinking that permeates almost everything\n  our society does.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Marketplace thinking fails to capture the value of academia because most of\n  the benefits of academia do not carry a direct, quantifiable, financial gain.</em></p>\n  \n  <p>A college education is now viewed as a means to a purely financial end, rather\n  than something with inherent value both to the individual receiving it and the\n  society of which that individual is a member. Quite simply, people are being\n  trained to look at a degree as a way to get a job; the chief way of determining\n  whether or not a college education is worth it is to perform a <em>shudder</em>\n  financial return on investment calculation and pretty much ignore all of the\n  other benefits that a college education confers.</p>\n  \n  <p>If that&#8217;s the way an education is to be perceived, its costs will go up while\n  its quality goes down. Administrators will seek to remove every part of the\n  experience that doesn&#8217;t contribute to making someone more employable (goodbye\n  liberal arts education!) while simultaneously delivering the &#8220;essential&#8221; parts\n  as cheaply as possible (hello adjuncts!). All the while, prices will go up to\n  reflect the (ick) &#8220;increased earning potential&#8221; of graduates.</p>\n  \n  <p>Research suffers for similar reasons &#8211; the public is being trained to demand a\n  financial return on a financial investment, but that&#8217;s simply not the way\n  research works. Most research will produce very little practical knowledge that\n  leaks out into the real world in the form of products or technologies; the\n  handful of projects that do literally transform how we live and think. The\n  problem is that we can&#8217;t identify which projects will be which before we\n  actually commit, so we&#8217;ve got to do a lot of them with the knowledge that most\n  won&#8217;t yield much. This kind of thinking is total anathema to the market because\n  everyone expects returns on each individual project!</p>\n  \n  <p>This will never get fixed unless the public&#8217;s perceptions of what education and\n  research are for are dramatically changed. We all need to stop thinking so\n  damned much about money (specifically, accumulating obscene amounts of it) and\n  start focusing on a more abstract definition of quality of life. There needs to\n  be a new framework for evaluating the value of things and activities that\n  doesn&#8217;t simply fall back on a bottom line calculation. This is going to be a\n  glacial shift in thinking, but it&#8217;s the only long-game I can come up with\n  that&#8217;s going to allow academia to reach its potential.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(via\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-biggest-obstacle-in-reforming-academia-today/answer/Brian-Farley-3">Quora</a>)</p>\n', 'max_subpages': None, 'template': 'post.haml', 'sort_reverse': True}, {'subpages': [], 'author': 'Vivek Rai', 'sort_key': None, 'excerpt': u'An introduction to my research internship\n', 'date': datetime.datetime(2015, 5, 23, 0, 0), 'slug': u'intern-at-iisc', 'category': 'science', 'index': False, 'target': u'science/intern-at-iisc.html', 'title': 'Working with pore forming toxin-1', 'url': u'science/intern-at-iisc.html', 'checksum': 'k\x14\xc9O\xa5\x9e\x9b\xf3"%\xae\x0c\xd6%Z1', 'rel_site_url': '..', 'modified': 1489504939.295795, 'filename': '/home/vivekrai/src/shorts/content/science/intern-at-iisc.mkd', 'content': u'<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cA learning experience is one of those things that says, &#8216;You know that thing\n  you just did?

It seemed like a reasonable place to\nattract further ideas and help. Sadly, I could not get in touch with my advisor\nbefore the abstract submission deadline and did not submit a poster.\nNevertheless, it was fun to listen to new speakers and learn about new\ndevelopments in the field. You never know where ideas can come from.</p>\n\n<p>The workshop consisted of 8 invited lectures, 6 short talks combined with\na poster session spanning over two days. There were no <em>hands on</em> or practical\nsessions even though the event was called <em>a workshop</em>. I guess it is because of\nthe short talks, a 15-minute presentation given by Ph.D. students as about their work.</p>\n\n<h4>Venue</h4>\n\n<p>IISER-K is\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Indian+Institute+of+Science+Education+and+Research+Kolkata/@22.962533,88.5201464,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x39f8bf0ebd68bc8b:0x92d423474389ff5c?hl=en">located</a>\nabout 50 km from <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata">Kolkata</a>, the nearest\nmetropolitan and also my home city.

(<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://barabasilab.com/">Barabasi</a> <em>et al.</em>)\nPrimarily because advancement in data acquisition platforms has enabled us to\ngenerate a huge amount of <em>omics</em> data\n- genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, fluxomics to name a few.\n  The variety and complexity of data has attracted specialized knowledge of\n  different scientific domains, especially inter-disciplinary participation from\n  physics and mathematics.</p>\n\n<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://iiti.ac.in/people/~sarika/"><strong>Sarika Jalan</strong></a> heads the Complex Systems Lab at Indian Institute of Technology\nIndore. She is trying to create a universal framework for a generalized\nanalysis of protein-protein interaction data from diseased cells. It \nwill allow one to easily identify key players that cause transition from normal\nto the cancerous stage.</p>\n\n<p>Later, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://bic.boseinst.ernet.in/indrani/"><strong>Indrani Bose</strong></a>, an eminent senior physicist at Bose Institute provided\na hardcore illustration of the cells as complex systems by expanding on the\ntopic of cell differentiation. The talk was dense but the key idea was to convey\nthe importance of noise and heterogeneity in the cellular system as an important\ncomponent of the decision making including cell differentiation. I will list\na couple of interesting papers she suggested for more information.</p>\n\n<h5>Big data analysis</h5>\n\n<p>It should no longer be surprising that a computational biology workshop involves\na large number of talks on big data analysis or <em>multi-omics</em> integration. The\ntalks by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.crraoaimscs.org/faculty/spyne/"><strong>Saumyadipta Pyne</strong></a> (IIPH\nHyderabad) and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iitgn.ac.in/faculty/Social%20Sciences/krishna.htm"><strong>Krishna\nPrasad</strong></a> (IIT\nGandhinagar) focused on acquisition and analysis of high dimensional data either\nfrom single cell analysis or neuroimaging data. In these cases, often the\nbreakthrough is in creating a new model that describes your data instead of\ntrying to reduce its complexity.</p>\n\n<h5>Computational protein design</h5>\n\n<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pralay/"><strong>Pralay Mitra</strong></a> gave an interesting talk\noutlining a general computational strategy of protein design. For those who are\nunfamiliar, protein design is an inverse problem of protein folding, wherein you\nstart from a known structure and its sequence and work out alternative\nsequences. The motivation for this problem is rather subtle as to why would\nanyone want to have a different sequence for the same structure. And if different,\nwhy not just carry out a single mutagenesis. The central idea, however, is not to\ngenerate just a different sequence but a novel sequence with strikingly\ndifferent properties of interest. For example, we may want a protein structure\nwith same sequence but different affinity so that it acts as an inhibitor.\nA reverse engineering problem. One may also notice that protein design problem\ninherently involves a protein folding problem as well.</p>\n\n<p>But how do you do it? Perhaps, I will write about it in detail in my other\nposts.</p>\n\n<h5>Mechanical organization of cell</h5>\n\n<p>The talks by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/en/employee/prof-anirban-sain"><strong>Anirban\nSain</strong></a> (IIT Bombay) and\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/~ranjith/"><strong>Ranjith Padinhateeri</strong></a> (IIT Bombay)\naimed to understand the mechanical organization of a cell. How does the dynamics\nof cytoskeletal filaments drive shape transformation, cell division and other\nprocesses that require force generation and modulation?</p>\n\n<p>A good part about these talks were the pretty electron microscopy pictures they\nshow.</p>\n\n<h5>Short talks and Posters</h5>\n\n<p>Several short talks and posters by Ph.D. students were presented. Different\nconcepts like game theory, protein-protein interaction networks, molecular\ndynamics simulation, spectral graph theory, and neuroscience came up in the\ndiscussion.</p>\n\n<h5>Other</h5>\n\n<p>Some relevant techniques (or terms) that I wish to read upon and explore\nfurther are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD)</li>\n<li>Riboswitch Scanner Tool</li>\n<li>Molecular Dynamics tools - Amber12, Chimera tool etc.</li>\n<li>Studying transient dynamics, Langevin equations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Possibly in my undergraduate thesis itself.</p>\n\n<h3>Criticism</h3>\n\n<p>One fact that disappoints me slightly is that most of the researchers do not\nreally care about experimental evidence in support of the theory or analysis\nthey put forward\u2014or if they do, do not have a plan about it. The general\nattitude is, &#8220;<em>We&#8217;re done. It is now up to others to build on this work and\nvalidate.</em>&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>We need more collaborations.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, a good workshop to spend the weekend. I am glad to have made a company\nof like minded people as well.</p>\n', 'max_subpages': None, 'template': 'post.haml', 'sort_reverse': True}, {'subpages': [], 'author': 'Vivek Rai', 'sort_key': None, 'excerpt': u'A comprehensive and thrilling experience\n', 'date': datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 15, 0, 0), 'slug': u'winter-school', 'category': 'science', 'index': False, 'target': u'science/winter-school.html', 'title': 'Notes from Systems Biology Winter School', 'url': u'science/winter-school.html', 'checksum': '\xb0\xf4y\x01\xa6*\xca\x80\x98Di\x8f|G\xc3~', 'rel_site_url': '..', 'modified': 1482516084.4839642, 'filename': '/home/vivekrai/src/shorts/content/science/winter-school.md', 'content': u'<p>This winter, I attended the fourth session of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.icts.res.in/program/current/details/361/">Winter School on Quantitative\nSystems Biology</a> at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://icts.res.in">International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS)</a>,\nBangalore.

This turns out to be an effective strategy and significantly\nreduces the learning effort during the main school for the people from diverse backgrounds.\nPrimarily because the main school is quite intensive with the series of lectures,\nresearch talks, poster presentation, and discussion sessions scheduled in\nsuccession.

The\n  focus is on the basics of cellular life and the principles thereof. The\n  emphasis is on the structures and processes that allow bacteria to survive,\n  reproduce, evolve and form communities in their environment. This is a setting\n  that is fertile for quantitative work, both theoretical and experimental, and\n  for grasping some universals in biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Participants</h3>\n\n<p>To my surprise, most (~80%) of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.icts.res.in/additional_page/721/">school\nparticipants</a> were either\nphysicists or mathematicians. Being in a crowd of this composition, as\na biologist (though my background is more on engineering side), provides you an\nexcellent peek of how others perceive and understand the key concepts that we\nbiologists often take for granted.

Although, it is easy to\nunderstand the behavior of a motif on an individual level, it is reasonably\nchallenging to comprehend the complex <em>emergent</em> behavior of the total network\nthey give rise to.</p>\n\n<p>We may ask, how does a cell use these simple motifs to generate increasingly\ncomplex behaviors? Can we predict them? Even harder to answer, how to\nascertain these explanations experimentally? A lot remains to be answered.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, I found the discussion of Savageau&#8217;s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9691027"><em>Demand\nTheory</em></a> and Riboswitches pretty\nfascinating.</p>\n\n<h4>Bacterial physiology</h4>\n\n<p>I had a notion that a lot of work(*) has been done in mainstream microbiology\ncausing people to shift away from it to modern buzzwords in biology. However, in\nthis school, I realized that it <em>still</em> is the bread and butter for many\nscientists, and people are continuing to push the boundaries with their rich work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Matthew Scott</strong> walked us through an entire theory of quantitative\nbacterial physiology using the classic case studies from the 60s. The key question\nbeing - How do the growth, size, cell cycle, macromolecular composition and\nmorphology of a cell coordinate? Can we predict anything? In an answer to these\nquestions, concepts of growth law, proteome partitioning, generation time versus\ndivision time puzzle, along with comprehensive quantitative models of growth\nwere discussed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Suckjoon Jun</strong> built upon the content discussed by Matt Scott and described his\nwork on <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://jun.ucsd.edu/mother_machine.php"><em>mother machine</em></a> and how they have used it to conduct experiments. The\nkey idea of his lectures were to infer the physiological and metabolic control\nparameters of a bacterial cell that can explain the phenomenon of size and\ngrowth homeostasis. They have proposed <strong>adder theory</strong> as an explanation to\ncell size homeostasis and hypothesize growth \\( (\\lambda) \\) and size \\((\\Delta)\\) as two independent\nand sufficient control parameters for bacterial physiological regulation.\nA great example of theory backed by rigid experiments.</p>\n\n<p>* <small> Thanks to\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Cooper/citations">Cooper</a>,\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Monod">Monod</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/microbiology-immunology/frederick-c-neidhardt-phd">Helmstetter</a>,\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/faculty/schaechter.htm">Schaechter</a> et al. in 50s.\n</small></p>\n\n<h4>Metabolism and biochemical networks</h4>\n\n<p>After regulatory network, metabolic network is the next most important towards\nrealization of a whole-cell model (ultimate goal of systems biology?).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nathan Price</strong> discussed some of standard techniques and algorithms used in\nmetabolic network model construction and analysis. Apparently, creating a full\ngenome scale metabolic network is significantly challenging and a humongous task\ntypically involving data collection, literature mining, processing, analysis,\nvalidation, and curation as essential steps. At each step, there are tricky issues of dealing\nwith missing values, and using right scoring function and database to use. Once you have\nreconstructed a network, next step is to find out its valid states. A widely\nused\ntechnique used for network reconstruction and analysis is COnstraint-Based\nReconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) that employs physicochemical and biological\nconstraints to limit the space of phenotypic states of a network in a given\ncondition. Naturally, here also <em>more data beats a complex model</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&ensp;&ensp;Once we have constructed a valid metabolic network, the\nnext step could be to integrate it with the regulatory network. The enhanced\nnetwork can now be used in retrospect to improve gene annotation, identify new\nmetabolites and thereby improve itself. It also incorporates an amazing\npredictive power that may guide new biological hypothesis development. In fact,\nanything that you can do with a standard network can be done with this network,\nadded with a biological significance.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>Mathhias Heinemann</strong> took us to metabolism on a single cell\nlevel and discussed how cells regulate their metabolism. He proposed an elegant\n<em>flux-sensing mechanism</em> used by the cells to continuously measure their outside\nenvironment and carry out internal changes. A great study by his group\ndemonstrated the phenotypic bistability of <em>E.coli</em>&#8217;s central carbon metabolism\nand how it can be achieved by a simple use of few <em>flux-sensors</em> along the\nnetwork.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, the project component I was involved in was also based on\nmetabolic network analysis. Perhaps, that should go in my next post.</p>\n\n<h4>Evolution</h4>\n\n<p>Since the seminal work of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/history_14">Darwin and Wallace</a> almost two centuries ago, evolution\nis still one of the hottest studied areas. The school witnessed several lectures\nand research talks on topics like evolutionary dynamics, molecular evolution\nwith interesting theories put forward frequently.</p>\n\n<p>At ETH Zurich, <strong>Andreas Wagner</strong> is trying to understand the origin of innovations,\ncomplexity and diversity of life using <em>systems approach</em>. The primary question\nbeing, &#8220;<em>Are there any principles of innovability in nature that govern the\narrival of fittest? Or is it just random mutation and selection over\nthe evolutionary period?</em>&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>However, one must carefully distinguish <em>innovation</em> with <em>adaptation</em> to\nunderstand the question correctly.</p>\n\n<p>&ensp;&ensp;His group is looking for answers by probing the metabolic phenotype and\ngenotype space and their relation in a network. The analysis yields few\ncurious results like -</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Two genotypes can differ (determined by a distance function D) strikingly\ndespite having the same phenotype.</li>\n<li>A genotype can have quite a diverse neighborhood. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A consequence of these two properties is that it is really <em>not that difficult</em>\nfor a genotype to acquire a new, unique phenotype. Combine with regulatory\nphenotype space, protein sequence space \\((20^n)\\), RNA sequence space\n\\((4^n)\\) etc., you have a multi-dimensional space to possibly generate any\ncombination with very few step movements across the hyperspace. More info in his\npapers.</p>\n\n<p>If this seems too computational to your taste, <strong>Tzachi Pilpel</strong> discussed how\nevolution occurs at the level of gene expression and related processes with\na considerable experimental effort. A series of interesting papers on how transcription\nand translation networks may have evolved. The fact that even <em>tRNA abundance</em>\ncould be optimized for, and can be used as an active means of control is\nbeautiful.</p>\n\n<p>Another exciting set of experiments were done by <strong>Tom Kuhlmann</strong> whose group\nwanted to understand the role of transposons in evolution. The experiments\nbeautifully showed transposons in action, in <em>real-time</em> using a rather simple\nplasmid construct. Quite a few conclusions follow from these experiments that\nI encourage anyone to look up in his papers.</p>\n\n<h4>Energy, information and computation in cells</h4>\n\n<p>How do cells perform computation?(*) And what is it that requires energy? Is\neverything inside a cell only driven by thermodynamics and a careful design of\nfree energy cascade? Do these processes have any fundamental limitations that\nbiological systems have to obey?</p>\n\n<p>As it turns out, <em>reality</em> is not so simple.</p>\n\n<p>* <small>Sensing the chemical gradient, Random walks, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nature.com/news/how-brainless-slime-molds-redefine-intelligence-1.11811">Slime molds</a> etc.</small> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Pankaj Mehta</strong>, a physicist from Boston University, works on elegant theories\nto answer these questions. They key motivation of his talks was to investigate\n<em>no-go</em> theories in biology, and their possible use in the design of synthetic\ncellular modules and circuits. He discussed two classical papers, <em>Kinetic\nProofreading</em> by Hopfield et al. (1994), and <em>Physics of Chemoreception</em> by Burg and\nPurcell (1975). The two papers provide an excellent discussion of how cells employ\nactive processes to increase their specificity. Turns out, that&#8217;s where you\nbreak the <em>time-reversal symmetry</em> and hence <em>have to</em> consume energy.</p>\n', 'max_subpages': None, 'template': 'post.haml', 'sort_reverse': True, 'math': True}, {'subpages': [], 'author': 'Vivek Rai', 'sort_key': None, 'excerpt': u'Wikipedia article entry for ISCB competition\n', 'date': datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 19, 0, 0), 'slug': u'wikiproject-submission', 'category': 'science', 'index': False, 'target': u'science/wikiproject-submission.html', 'title': 'WikiProject article submission', 'url': u'science/wikiproject-submission.html', 'checksum': 'NgMOU_\x80u\xecN\x84\xd0\x85\xdd\x05\xdf', 'rel_site_url': '..', 'modified': 1453406125.4565208, 'filename': '/home/vivekrai/src/shorts/content/science/wikiproject-submission.md', 'content': u'<p>Almost an year ago, I had written a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/old/blog/contributing-to-wikipedia-wikiprojects.html">blog post</a> about different Wikipedia\nWikiProjects and how one could contribute to them.

These\ncomponents could be genes, enzymes, reactions, metabolites or other factors.\nThe nodes store data while edges relate them according to a specific nature of\nrelationship. For example, think of a social network where people are nodes and edges\nstore the friendship information.</p>\n\n<p>A metabolic network, thus, must represent the metabolic process using nodes and\nedges.</p>\n\n<h4>Storing the data</h4>\n\n<p>Thousands of chemical reactions occur at a time, even in relatively simpler\norganisms like <em>E.coli</em>. A popular and computationally amenable way to store\nthis information is in the form of a matrix, called a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bio-physics.at/wiki/index.php?title=Stoichiometric_Matrix"><strong>stoichiometry\nmatrix</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>A stoichiometry matrix records the relationship between different metabolites and\nthe particular chemical reactions they participate in. If you are familiar with\nnetworks already, it is similar to an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix">adjacency matrix</a> representation.</p>\n\n<h4>Example</h4>\n\n<p>Consider the following sample of chemical reactions take from <em>E.coli</em> BL21(DE3)\nstrain, a popularly used <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_%28biotechnology%29">expression host</a>.</p>\n\n<p>$$ ade_c + prpp_c \u2192 amp_c + ppi_c \\tag{1} $$\n$$ 3amac_c + h_c + h2o_c \u2192 msa_c + nh4_c \\tag{2} $$\n$$ accoa_c + h2o_c + oaa_c \u2192 cit_c + coa_c + h_c \\tag{3} $$</p>\n\n<p><small class="hint">Hint: Confused about symbols?

We\u2019ll\ncome back to this later.</p>\n\n<h3>Network construction</h3>\n\n<h4>Creating stoichiometry matrix</h4>\n\n<p>To construct a stoichiometry matrix, we need to have the following information\n(both of which are present in model file):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Participating metabolites \\(( \\vec{m} )\\)</li>\n<li>(Balanced) Chemical reactions \\(( \\vec{R} )\\)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Following from previous example, we can see that \\( \\vec{m} \\) is\na vector of size \\( m = 13 \\) (unique metabolites) and \\( \\vec{R} \\) is of\nsize \\( n = 3 \\). The resulting stoichiometry matrix \\(( S )\\) is of size \\(\nm \\times n \\), where each row represents a metabolite and each column represents\na reaction. Each cell \\((c_{ij})\\) populated using a simple rule \u2014 \\(a\\) if\na metabolite is produced in that reaction, \\(- a\\) if consumed, 0 otherwise;\nwhere \\(a\\) is the stoichiometry coefficient of the metabolite.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a stoichiometry for reaction \\( (1) \\) will be:</p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\nade_c & -1\\\\\\ prpp_c & -1\\\\\\ amp_c & 1\\\\\\ ppi_c & 1 \\\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$</p>\n\n<p><small class="hint">\nExercise: Try writing S matrix for all three reactions.<br>\nExercise: Write a (Python?) script to create S matrix from a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://gist.github.com/vivekiitkgp/6474b821b96dfdb9b21a">list</a> of reactions.\nExercise: Write a program to find all the reactions in which a given metabolite participates.\n</small></p>\n\n<h4>Other matrices</h4>\n\n<p>Similarly, you can create different matrices containing other kind of reaction\ninformation. For example, elemental matrix (\\( \\vec{E} \\)), charge-balance\nmatrix, moiety matrix, flux matrix (\\( \\vec{v} \\)).</p>\n\n<p>These matrices combined with a stoichiometry matrix yield necessary information\nabout a reaction, like atoms and charged species involved, rate of concentration\nchanges etc.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of using matrices is that conservation principles can be verified\nthrough a simple matrix multiplication.</p>\n\n<h3>Visualizing the network</h3>\n\n<p>Once the metabolic network model grows beyond a few reactions and metabolites,\nit becomes increasingly difficult to visualize the relationship between the\ncomponents. Visualization allows us to observe key network structures, critical\npathways and important metabolites without much analysis.</p>\n\n<h4>Reaction and compound maps</h4>\n\n<p>A common strategy is to visualize the content of stoichiometry matrix in two\nways - a <em>reaction map</em> and <em>metabolite map</em>.</p>\n\n<p>A reaction map is drawn with metabolites as nodes and reactions as edges. The\nedges link the metabolite nodes which are consumed in the reaction to the\nmetabolite nodes which are produced in the reaction. The nature of\n(ir)reversible nature of reaction can be indicated by the direction of the link.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, a compound map consists of reactions as nodes and metabolites\nas edges. In a similar manner, edges link the reaction nodes where a metabolite\nis produced to the reaction where it is consumed.</p>\n\n<p>Both of these representations draw attention to different aspects of the same\nmetabolic network. For example, the reaction map allows us to visualize\nthe most important metabolites of the network while the metabolite map allows us\nto distinguish the core reactions.</p>\n\n<p><small class="hint">\nExercise: Write the compound map for the S matrix of above three reactions.<br>\nExercise: Write a program to generate reaction and compound map graphs in\nmemory.\n</small></p>\n\n<h4>Other tools</h4>\n\n<p>Some common ways to visualize a network is to use a tool like\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">Cytospace</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://visant.bu.edu/">visANT</a>.</p>\n\n<p><small class="hint">\nExercise: Draw the graphs using a visualization library in your language of\nchoice (networkx in Python).\n</small></p>\n\n<h3>Further</h3>\n\n<p>A lot remains to be discussed. In the next tutorial of this series, we\u2019ll look\nclosely at stoichiometry matrix, use complete models, derive useful properties,\nand learn ways to simulate the model. Towards the end, I hope that a small\ncase-study will serve as a comprehensive example to assimilate all the\ninformation.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, feel free to experiment with the exercises and send in your\nsuggestions.</p>\n', 'max_subpages': None, 'template': 'post.haml', 'sort_reverse': True, 'math': True}, {'subpages': [], 'author': 'Vivek Rai', 'sort_key': None, 'excerpt': u'How the BEST ever internship concluded.\n', 'date': datetime.datetime(2015, 7, 27, 0, 0), 'slug': u'intern-at-iisc-2', 'category': 'science', 'index': False, 'target': u'science/intern-at-iisc-2.html', 'title': 'Working with pore forming toxin-2', 'url': u'science/intern-at-iisc-2.html', 'checksum': '\xac\xb2\xca\xc4n\xe3\x81\xd5u\xe4\x10\xb6!>)\xab', 'rel_site_url': '..', 'modified': 1472579103.7516541, 'filename': '/home/vivekrai/src/shorts/content/science/intern-at-iisc-2.mkd', 'content': u'<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day.

The final week saw several rounds of data review,\ngraph redraw and extensive literature review to collect appropriate and verifiable\nreferences along with relevant information. I&#8217;m, however, glad of the fact that\nmost of the report compilation was done independently by me, with Pradeep (my\nmentor) offering some key inputs across the report. Finally to top my excitement,\nit was very well received by my adviser Prof. Sandhya, who also happened to\nglance across my website (shorts!) and grew fond of it.</p>\n\n<p>Once the report submission was made, we had a picnic arranged to a nearby place\ncalled <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Lepakshi,+Andhra+Pradesh+515331/@13.804804,77.6066923,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3bb19833ae8b38c7:0xe42e0f43a3da5ef1?hl=en"><em>Lepakshi</em></a>, where we co-interns along with our mentors and other\nbioengineering students had a lot of fun.

I get up, walk up to the podium, put down my\ntranscript and forget everything for a second. I look up at my slides and begin\nexplaining as if it&#8217;s coming naturally to me. Minutes later, I&#8217;m done with\npresentation and answered all audience questions. Later, I was told by Sandhya\nthat all the professors loved the presentation - good content combined with\nprofessional style of presentation. I took a sigh of relief.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I&#8217;m not just taking back a reports and certificate from IISc.,\nbut a whole bunch of memories and inspiring experiences. I have learned to be more\ncurious and enthusiastic about things around me, observe things closely and\nconstantly ask <em>Why?</em>, do <em>vertical</em> research, do smart work, interact with\npeers, build connections, be independent, and lastly assume humility.

While all of the lectures\nwere insightful, one which caught my most attention were those delivered\nDr. Aditya Murthy on neuroscience. His amazing presentation skills, sense of\nhumor and rigor left me in awe!</p>\n\n<p>The end of the internship marked the beginning of the seventh semester and my\npre-final year. I felt fresh and enthused about learning more of what I had\njust scratched the surface back then. Accordingly, I had to formulate a course\nplan to steer me in that direction. While, I was still on it, finding\n<em>meaningful</em> subjects among tens of options, freeing up slots and what not, I\nlearned about a new course being offered this fall. Guess what? <strong>Computational\nNeuroscience</strong>! There was no time to waste.</p>\n\n<p>The course is taken by by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/fac-profiles/showprofile.php?empcode=SWmdR&amp;depts_name=EC">Prof. Sharba\nBandhopadhyay</a>\nof E&amp;ECE department. As expected, the course turned out to be very demanding\nfrom the very beginning. A lot of background in mathematics, some in subjects\nof electronics which are usually not taught to biotechnology students, had to\nbe covered for clearer understanding. Moreover, the course involved several\nsimulation based projects to be done in MATLAB. Top up the entire package with\nsurprise quizzes. Unfortunately, it took a heavy toll on a lot of people who\nweren&#8217;t prepared to devote enough time and therefore dropped from the course.\nAt this point, I must praise the efforts by the teacher in order to help out\nthe students. He allowed all the class tests and even exams to be open\nbook/notes (with access to laptops if need be!) and took great care in\ndispensing proper resources for catching up on concepts.</p>\n\n<p>As far the content of the course is considered, I learned a lot of new things.\n<strong>First</strong>, it forced me to revisit my mathematical knowledge which I was beginning\nto lose due to continued exposure to just biology. <strong>Second</strong>, it provided an\nincentive to learn MATLAB (and equivalent in Python) for simulation projects.\n<strong>Finally</strong>, it helped me understand the process of computational modeling, setting\nup equations, and the model complexity-interpretability trade-off.</p>\n\n<p>Beside this, I also have several other courses among which <strong>Gene Expression</strong> and\n<strong>Data Analytics</strong> are my next favorites. The latter course is an applied version\nof more formal Machine Learning course and involves programming assignments\nand data analysis projects in R.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, this semester has a well balanced mix of courses to equip me with some\nmore skills and practical experience as I work across different projects. Looking\nforward to completing it with great success.</p>\n', 'max_subpages': None, 'template': 'post.haml', 'sort_reverse': True}, {'subpages': [], 'author': 'Vivek Rai', 'sort_key': None, 'excerpt': u'One must understand good research to do good research.\n', 'date': datetime.datetime(2015, 4, 4, 0, 0), 'slug': u'papers-per-week', 'category': 'science', 'index': False, 'target': u'science/papers-per-week.html', 'title': 'Papers per week', 'url': u'science/papers-per-week.html', 'checksum': '\xcb]\xf9\xd8\xf4+\x89\xd3\x12\xcc\xfd8\x19\xfe\x10+', 'rel_site_url': '..', 'modified': 1453405745.3965054, 'filename': '/home/vivekrai/src/shorts/content/science/papers-per-week.mkd', 'content': u'<blockquote>\n  <p>Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody\n  else has thought.</p>\n  \n  <p>Albert Szent-Gyorgyi</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Reading research papers, literature survey as one may call it, is one of the\nprimary tasks of any research enthusiast, student, academician, or researcher.\nAs we advance through our academic career, the complexity and quantity of\ncontent keeps increasing until the text books give up. The inflow of\ninformation is too rapid and too vast to be contained and sufficiency conveyed\nto the target audience, thus necessitating the need of specialized sources.</p>\n\n<p>Research papers act as such specialized source and focus clearly on a topic,\nexpress rigorous discussions, distinguishes between reliable and biased\nsources, between authoritative and questionable statistics, and between fact\nand opinion. Peer reviewed journals take this even further by ensuring that\nsubmitted articles always meet a certain quality and standard criteria. It is\none of the reasons that journals like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nature.com">nature</a>,\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://sciencemag.com">science</a> are highly acclaimed.</p>\n\n<p>Although, reading research papers often requires effort mostly because of\nhighly condensed information and intended audience, but they provide a great\ninsight into the design and thought process. They help you picture the whole\nsetup and perform each and every step mentally (even reproduce in your lab!)\nand understand the big picture.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, in an effort to align my research interests and expand knowledge\npool, I have started an initiative to try reading at least two papers a week.\nThese papers will be selected based on my interest area, its popularity and\nfaculty recommendations. Also, to ensure that I&#8217;m just not skimming through\nthe content but trying to understand it, I&#8217;ll try writing an one page review\naccording to a fixed template. Following this template should ensure that I do\na critical and creative thinking of the paper.</p>\n\n<p>You can find a list of all the papers I have read along with the one page\nreviews at\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/papers-per-week"><strong>papers-per-week</strong></a>.

Such\nadvances have revolutionized the way we live today by integrating into the\ndeepest spheres of our lives.</p>\n\n<p>But despite significant advances in recent decades, there are more questions to\nexplore than ever before. We are witnessing a fundamental shift in the nature\nand method of the scientific discovery process from the past. Single\ndisciplinary science is becoming rarer, and so is the era of monogamous\ncollaboration. A lot of exciting stuff is coming from the people working on the\ninterfaces and borrowing ideas from multiple disciplines.

NCBS is a research\ninstitute, a unit of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tifr.res.in">Tata Institute of Fundamental\nResearch</a> (TIFR), specializing in biological research.\nIt is worth mentioning that TIFR and its centres are one of the top contributors to\ntotal research output from India.<sup id="a1"><a href="#id1">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The school consists of a seven-day program involving didactic lectures, research\ntalks, laboratory visits, interactive sessions, and a final project component.\nAimed principally at science undergraduates across all disciplines, the school\nseeks to expose students to an interdisciplinary approach towards doing science,\nand motivate them to seek problems at the interface of biology and other\nsciences.</p>\n\n<figure style="text-align:center">\n<img\n    src="/images/simons.png"\n    title="9.30am to 5pm schedule with lots of learning and refreshments!"\n    style="width: 125%; margin-left:-12.5%; height: auto"/>\n<figcaption>\n  Seven day schedule of talks and presentations. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://theory.ncbs.res.in/physlife2017">(Further details)</a>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The program featured pedagogic lectures with researchers from NCBS,\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://icts.res.in">ICTS</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a>,\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.imsc.res.in/">IMSc</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jncasr.ac.in/">JNCASR</a>, and\n<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iisc.ac.in">IISc</a> delivered to a class of 37 students. Mukund\nThattai kick-started the school with a preview of numbers in biology and\nbuilding the motivation of problem-solving using reasoned estimates and\nscientific methodology. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.imsc.res.in/~rsidd/">Rahul Siddhartan</a> from\nIMSc talked about modeling biological sequences with a brief review of Bayesian\nprobability, Markov models, and alignment algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>From Monday to Wednesday, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jncasr.ac.in/jain/">Kavita Jain</a> from JNCASR talked about the modern synthesis\nof evolution and how it has evolved from Darwin&#8217;s original ideas from <em>The\nOrigin of Species</em>. With a discussion on important evolutionary processes, she\ndelved into ideas of population genetics using simple models (Hardy-Weinberg\nequilibrium, Wright-Fisher process for example) to understand the role of genetic drift, mutation,\nselection and stochasticity in a population.  <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~manojg">Manoj Gopalkrishnan</a> from IIT\nBombay talked about implications of life and what does it mean to be living,\nfrom a biological and physical point of view. He then build upon those ideas to\ndraw a parallel between <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory"> thermodynamics of a cell and information theory</a>,\ndiscussing the design and limitations of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.auburn.edu/~smith01/notes/maxdem.htm">Maxwell&#8217;s demon</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Szilard_engine&amp;redirect=no">Szilard&#8217;s engine</a>;\nand finally building towards The Szilard-Landauer Correspondence.<sup id="a2"><a href="#id2">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://home.icts.res.in/~vijay/">Vijay Krishnamurthy</a> from ICTS studies physical biology and soft-condensed matter\nphysics, and he built upon the same ideas. Posing questions like <em>What states\nof matter are biological systems in and how are they constituted?</em> He provided\na conceptual background of Brownian motion and how a study of dynamics from the\nrelated principles (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system">Reaction-diffusion system</a>, for example) could give rise to complex emergent phenomenon such as <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wired.com/2011/02/turing-patterns/">Turing\npatterns</a> formation\u2014an\ninteresting study of which is the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486416/">digit patterning in a mouse</a>. Coming from\na biological background, I was highly impressed by Vijay&#8217;s lecture and the way\nhe told his story.</p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, Mukund Thattai got back to his ideas from the first day and posed\na question on the precision of life. Specifically, <em>how precise is life and\nhow is his precision generated?</em> For demonstration, he discussed the famous\npaper by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/911982">Berg and Purcell (1977)</a>.\nHowever, in his approach, he relied very little on the directly borrowing ideas\nfrom the article and instead discussed the assumptions and approach from the ground\nup. In fact, he went as far as to derive and explain the calculation of sample mean\nand variance. In his last lecture, he discussed his paper on stochastic/noisy\nexpression of single gene and modeled its dynamics.<sup id="a3"><a href="#id3">3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>On Friday, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ncbs.res.in/faculty/sandeep">Sandeep Krishna</a> from NCBS held an interactive session in which we had\nto borrow ideas from biological systems and develop them into a playable game.\nA few exciting games from the session are now posted on the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://simonsgamesblog.wordpress.com/">Simons Games\nblog</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the final day before the presentation, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/">Vishu Guttal</a> from IISc focused on broader\necological aspects of evolution discussing how organisms interact with each\nother in a community and ways to understand their behavior theoretically and\nempirically. A famous example of predator-prey dynamics was also discussed.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, on the last day we had a career counseling session where we discussed\nexciting aspects of continuing in science and what does it mean to do research\nas a PhD student and a PI. The take home lesson was that a PhD is not supposed\nto be a world changing exercise or an attempt at becoming the best in the world\n(what most students suggested). Rather, it is more of an independent exercise\nand a critical milestone towards gaining exposure to the field of research:\na form of apprenticeship but with more independence and a demand of novelty and\nrigor. Following this session, different groups presented what they have been\nworking on during the school.</p>\n\n<figure style="text-align:center">\n<img\n    src="/images/simons_all.jpg"\n    title="The Physics of Life team"\n    style="width: 125%; margin-left:-12.5%; height: auto"/>\n<figcaption>\n    Participants of 5th Simons-NCBS Physics of Life Monsoon School.

Discussions with professors and how they are doing science\nraised some interesting questions that I have been thinking about. I am hoping to\nshare some of it shortly. However, I also feel that the lecture-style\ntheme of the school along with the depth to which the contents were covered are\nmore suitable for junior students, preferably those in their sophomore or junior\nyears. Lastly, the school provided an excellent opportunity to meet new friends and\nlearn from their interest and enthusiasm.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li><small id=id1> Van Noorden, R. (2015, May 13).
