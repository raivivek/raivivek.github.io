The reluctance to fund\nacademia and research, in turn, comes from a completely skewed perception by\nthe public of what academia is supposed to accomplish -- which in no small part\ncomes from the capitalist marketplace thinking that permeates almost everything\nour society does.</p>\n<p><em>Marketplace thinking fails to capture the value of academia because most of\nthe benefits of academia do not carry a direct, quantifiable, financial gain.</em></p>\n<p>A college education is now viewed as a means to a purely financial end, rather\nthan something with inherent value both to the individual receiving it and the\nsociety of which that individual is a member. Quite simply, people are being\ntrained to look at a degree as a way to get a job; the chief way of determining\nwhether or not a college education is worth it is to perform a <em>shudder</em>\nfinancial return on investment calculation and pretty much ignore all of the\nother benefits that a college education confers.</p>\n<p>If that\'s the way an education is to be perceived, its costs will go up while\nits quality goes down. Administrators will seek to remove every part of the\nexperience that doesn\'t contribute to making someone more employable (goodbye\nliberal arts education!) while simultaneously delivering the "essential" parts\nas cheaply as possible (hello adjuncts!). All the while, prices will go up to\nreflect the (ick) "increased earning potential" of graduates.</p>\n<p>Research suffers for similar reasons -- the public is being trained to demand a\nfinancial return on a financial investment, but that\'s simply not the way\nresearch works. Most research will produce very little practical knowledge that\nleaks out into the real world in the form of products or technologies; the\nhandful of projects that do literally transform how we live and think. The\nproblem is that we can\'t identify which projects will be which before we\nactually commit, so we\'ve got to do a lot of them with the knowledge that most\nwon\'t yield much. This kind of thinking is total anathema to the market because\neveryone expects returns on each individual project!</p>\n<p>This will never get fixed unless the public\'s perceptions of what education and\nresearch are for are dramatically changed. We all need to stop thinking so\ndamned much about money (specifically, accumulating obscene amounts of it) and\nstart focusing on a more abstract definition of quality of life. There needs to\nbe a new framework for evaluating the value of things and activities that\ndoesn\'t simply fall back on a bottom line calculation. This is going to be a\nglacial shift in thinking, but it\'s the only long-game I can come up with\nthat\'s going to allow academia to reach its potential.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(via\n<a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-biggest-obstacle-in-reforming-academia-today/answer/Brian-Farley-3">Quora</a>)</p>', 'url': u'science/research-needs-funding.html', 'max_subpages': None, 'template': 'post.haml', 'sort_reverse': True, 'date': datetime.datetime(2015, 4, 8, 0, 0), 'title': 'research needs funding', 'slug': u'research-needs-funding'}, {'category': 'science', 'index': False, 'subpages': [], 'target': u'science/intern-at-iisc.html', 'author': 'Vivek Rai', 'sort_key': None, 'checksum': '\xc7\xf9\xd7\xdb~\xdc\x90\x86\xab\xd6\xea\xc1R\xd3Fx', 'rel_site_url': '..', 'excerpt': u'An introduction to my research internship\n', 'modified': 1432402479.792794, 'filename': '/home/vivekrai/src/shorts/content/science/intern-at-iisc.mkd', 'content': u'<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cA learning experience is one of those things that says, \'You know that thing\nyou just did?

Finally to top my excitement,\nit was very well received by my adviser Prof. Sandhya, who also happened to\nglance across my website (shorts!) and grew fond of it.</p>\n<p>Once the report submission was made, we had a picnic arranged to a nearby place\ncalled <a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Lepakshi,+Andhra+Pradesh+515331/@13.804804,77.6066923,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3bb19833ae8b38c7:0xe42e0f43a3da5ef1?hl=en"><em>Lepakshi</em></a>, where we co-interns along with our mentors and other\nbioengineering students had a lot of fun.

I get up, walk up to the podium, put down my\ntranscript and forget everything for a second. I look up at my slides and begin\nexplaining as if it\'s coming naturally to me. Minutes later, I\'m done with\npresentation and answered all audience questions. Later, I was told by Sandhya\nthat all the professors loved the presentation - good content combined with\nprofessional style of presentation. I took a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>To keep it short, I\'m not just taking bag a few reports and certificates from\nIISc., but a whole bunch of memories and inspiring experiences. I learned to be\nmore curious and enthusiastic about things around me, observe things closely\nand constantly ask <em>Why?</em>, do <em>vertical</em> research, do smart work, interact with\npeers, build connections, be independent, and lastly assume humility. These are\nthe fundamental skills and attitude that will reflect throughout my life and\nhelp me become a better person and researcher, with the ability to navigate a\nlife path on my own.</p>\n<p>Thank you Indian Institute of Science!

While all of the lectures\nwere insightful, one which caught my most attention were those delivered\nDr. Aditya Murthy on neuroscience. His amazing presentation skills, sense of\nhumor and rigor left me in awe!</p>\n<p>The end of the internship marked the beginning of the seventh semester and my\npre-final year. I felt fresh and enthused about learning more of what I had\njust scratched the surface back then. Accordingly, I had to formulate a course\nplan to steer me in that direction. While, I was still on it, finding\n<em>meaningful</em> subjects among tens of options, freeing up slots and what not, I\nlearned about a new course being offered this fall. Guess what? <strong>Computational\nNeuroscience</strong>! There was no time to waste.</p>\n<p>The course is taken by by <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/fac-profiles/showprofile.php?empcode=SWmdR&amp;depts_name=EC">Prof. Sharba\nBandhopadhyay</a>\nof E&amp;ECE department. As expected, the course turned out to be very demanding\nfrom the very beginning. A lot of background in mathematics, some in subjects\nof electronics which are usually not taught to biotechnology students, had to\nbe covered for clearer understanding. Moreover, the course involved several\nsimulation based projects to be done in MATLAB. Top up the entire package with\nsurprise quizzes. Unfortunately, it took a heavy toll on a lot of people who\nweren\'t prepared to devote enough time and therefore dropped from the course.\nAt this point, I must praise the efforts by the teacher in order to help out\nthe students. He allowed all the class tests and even exams to be open\nbook/notes (with access to laptops if need be!) and took great care in\ndispensing proper resources for catching up on concepts.</p>\n<p>As far the content of the course is considered, I learned a lot of new things.\n<strong>First</strong>, it forced me to revisit my mathematical knowledge which I was beginning\nto lose due to continued exposure to just biology. <strong>Second</strong>, it provided an\nincentive to learn MATLAB (and equivalent in Python) for simulation projects.\n<strong>Finally</strong>, it helped me understand the process of computational modeling, setting\nup equations, and the model complexity-interpretability trade-off.</p>\n<p>Beside this, I also have several other courses among which <strong>Gene Expression</strong> and\n<strong>Data Analytics</strong> are my next favorites. The latter course is an applied version\nof more formal Machine Learning course and involves programming assignments\nand data analysis projects in R.</p>\n<p>Overall, this semester has a well balanced mix of courses to equip me with some\nmore skills and practical experience as I work across different projects. Looking\nforward to completing it with great success.</p>', 'url': u'science/course-catalog.html', 'max_subpages': None, 'template': 'post.haml', 'sort_reverse': True, 'date': datetime.datetime(2015, 9, 15, 0, 0), 'title': 'A challenging course catalog', 'slug': u'course-catalog'}, {'category': 'science', 'index': False, 'subpages': [], 'target': u'science/papers-per-week.html', 'author': 'Vivek Rai', 'sort_key': None, 'checksum': '\x0bN&\xeaP\x86T\x8b\xd3\x8f\xe2\x99\xda\xc3\x8c\xde', 'rel_site_url': '..', 'excerpt': u'One must understand good research to do good research.\n', 'modified': 1432402460.132697, 'filename': '/home/vivekrai/src/shorts/content/science/papers-per-week.mkd', 'content': u'<blockquote>\n<p>Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody\nelse has thought.</p>\n<p>Albert Szent-Gyorgyi</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>READING RESEARCH PAPERS, literature survey as one may call it, is one of the\nprimary tasks of any research enthusiast, student, academician, or researcher.\nAs we advance through our academic career, the complexity and quantity of\ncontent keeps increasing until the text books give up. The inflow of\ninformation is too rapid and too vast to be contained and sufficiency conveyed\nto the target audience, thus necessitating the need of specialized sources.</p>\n<p>Research papers act as such specialized source and focus clearly on a topic,\nexpress rigorous discussions, distinguishes between reliable and biased\nsources, between authoritative and questionable statistics, and between fact\nand opinion. Peer reviewed journals take this even further by ensuring that\nsubmitted articles always meet a certain quality and standard criteria. It is\none of the reasons that journals like <a href="https://nature.com">nature</a>,\n<a href="https://sciencemag.com">science</a> are highly acclaimed.</p>\n<p>Although, reading research papers often requires effort mostly because of\nhighly condensed information and intended audience, but they provide a great\ninsight into the design and thought process. They help you picture the whole\nsetup and perform each and every step mentally (even reproduce in your lab!)\nand understand the big picture.</p>\n<p>Consequently, in an effort to align my research interests and expand knowledge\npool, I have started an initiative to try reading at least two papers a week.\nThese papers will be selected based on my interest area, its popularity and\nfaculty recommendations. Also, to ensure that I\'m just not skimming through\nthe content but trying to understand it, I\'ll try writing an one page review\naccording to a fixed template.
