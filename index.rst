.. epigraph::
    “*The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.*”
    ― Socrates

A programmer and keen open source enthusiast who is also passionate about
Biology. I love to spend my time coding or reading a reasearch paper during a
beautiful sunset while sipping on my hot coffee.

This website hosts my interests and activities, some of which can also be found
on `Wikipedia`_ and `Quora`_. Although, most of my regular updates are now
posted in the `shorts`_ section.

**Recent shorts**

* `Protein Knots: A Tangled Story`_
* `Working With Pore Forming Toxin - 2`_
* `Working With Pore Forming Toxin - 1`_
* `WIGI, an inspire grantee`_

**Archived posts**

* `BLAST+ and Its Inconsistencies`_
