.. epigraph:: 
    “The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.” 
    ― Socrates

.. admonition:: 
    I am a third year undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology, 
    Kharagpur majoring in in Biotechnology and Biochemical engineering. 
    As a passionate learner and ardent linux user, I love Biology, Computer Science, 
    `Python`_, `Vim`_ , coffee and sunsets. This website hosts my interests and description
    besides the random rumblings of my life.

    When I am not working with any of these, one can find me lurking on Wikipedia [1]_
    or Quora [2]_.

    Here are a bunch of my latest blog posts:
