<h2>WIGI – An Inspire Grantee</h2>
<p class=subtitle> Assessing gender gap on Wikipedia </p>
</header>
<p><a href=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/WIGI:_Wikipedia_Gender_Index>The Wikipedia Indicators of Gender
Inequality</a>
(WIGI) project aims to study and characterize gender representation on Wikipedia by studying
trends in growth of biography articles. The project is led by
<a href=http://notconfusing.com>Maximilian Klein</a>, a PhD student at
the University of Minnesota, and Dr. Piotr Konieczny.</p>
<p>We aim to use <a href=https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page>Wikidata</a>
knowledge-base, which contains structured metadata about each Wikipedia
article, to develop indicators that measure gender representation and can
identify gender gaps that need to be systematically addressed by the
Wikipedia community.</p>
<p>Read our <a href=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IEG/WIGI:_Wikipedia_Gender_Index>proposal</a>.</p>
<p>The infographic below presents our hypothesis with some pilot data that we
have accumulated so far in an effort to showcase what can be done.</p>

<p>The obvious question that arises here is that why should we investigate the
trends in the gender of biography articles instead of the <em>trends in
editorship</em>, that is, observing the gender of the active editors on the
Wikipedia. Although, it is entirely possible that the editor-gender and
article-gender may not be related, a <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03086>pilot
research</a> that analyzed the biography gender
gap by date of birth, citizenship, and language <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20191006101615/https://notconfusing.com/preliminary-results-from-wigi-the-wikipedia-gender-inequality-index/>suggests</a> that these metrics correlate well with
historical census data, for example.</p>
<p>As Max quotes in his <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20191102015240/http://notconfusing.com/category/thought-importance/lesser/>blog
post</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last six months along with fellow Wikipedians we prototyped and
extended this research into a paper <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03086>Gender Gap Through Time and Space: A
Journey Through Wikipedia Biographies and the ‘WIGI’
Index</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The initial results in the manuscript look quite promising and offer
promising insights on worldwide longitudinal gender inequality trends.</p>
<p>However, these results were discussed only for a single snapshot in time and to
extend this research required further time and effort in form of a dedicated
team. With the help of a <a href=https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/05/01/meet-the-inspire-grantees/>$22,500
funding</a> from
<a href=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Inspire>Wikipedia Inspire Grant</a>, the
project has received a major impetus to implement a data portal that will
display the visualizations of the state of gender in biographies by sampling
the data on weekly basis and offer insightful statistical analyses.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal being to raise awareness of the gender gap using statistical
and quantitative means.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to discover the project during its formulation
period and to be a part of it as a developer and research team member. The
project is open to contribution and available entirely on
<a href=https://github.com/notconfusing/WIGI>github</a>.</p>
