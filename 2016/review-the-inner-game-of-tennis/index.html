<h2>Review: The Inner Game of Tennis</h2>
<p class=subtitle> Learn new skills by playing the inner game. </p>
</header>
<p>In the book ‘The Inner Game of Tennis’, author Timothy Gallway talks about
different aspects of learning (or acquiring) a new skill. He argues that key to
acquiring any new skill requires contribution from two distinct entities in your
brain, which he calls <em>Self-1</em> and <em>Self-2</em>. Tennis is simply an example author
uses to put forward his ideas and provide demonstration. More so, because he had
been a tennis coach and a good player himself. The two <em>selves</em> can loosely be
equated to <em>System 1</em> and <em>System 2</em> discussed by Daniel Kahneman in his famous
book <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow><em>Thinking Fast and
Slow</em></a>. I strongly
recommend the latter if you haven’t read it yet.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR; Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUdTxXkecr8">this</a> video.</strong></p>
<p>I liked the writing and found the author quite agreeable most of the times.
Perhaps because he did not attempt to make his descriptions appear scientific
and novel by supporting with hasty references. Instead, he chose to start with
a fundamental premise that continues through the ten chapters of the book, and
supports his ideas based on his personal experience as a learner and coach.</p>
<p>Timothy says that a player when learning a skill or playing a game are actually
playing two games. First, she is quite visibly trying to learn or do good in the
game by following instructions given by the coach. Second, she is playing an
‘inner game’ which exists in her mind between the two ‘selves’. The ‘Self 1’
which is the calculative, judgemental part which is actively trying to execute
the instructions, judge performance, and ‘trying hard’ to make it better. The
other ‘Self 2’ which is a detached observer of the game and is making the most
natural moves to accomplish the task hand, i.e., reach out to the ball and hit
it. It is the tussle or the nature of relationship between the two that
determines one’s ability to translate knowledge into effective action.</p>
<p>The author then devotes further chapters to describe the relationship between
the two and how it can be refined for better learning. The suggested strategies
are handful, and I have tried to list a few of them below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let go of judgement. Judgement provokes thinking process and initiates the
processing of ‘fixing’ things (if they are going wrong) or doing it right
repeatedly (if they are going right). Observe and absorb events are they
are, simply <em>acknowledge</em>. Positive thinking or compliments are also
judgement in disguise.</li>
<li>Trust your natural learning process. It is doing well to learn you the
necessary skills. Let is observe games, observe the events of the game. It
will auto correct itself as you try to imagine the ‘correct’ way to do
things. Do not force yourself.</li>
<li>Showing is better than telling. And in case you are provided instructions, use
them as a guide to achieve a particular end rather than following verbatim.</li>
<li>Fighting the mind to make a change does not work. What works best is learning
to focus it. It involves tricks like trying to watch the seam of the ball or
saying bounce-hit as the ball bounces across the court and let the ‘Self 2’
handle the game.</li>
<li>Watch ‘other’ games you play. For example, whether you are playing the game to
perfect yourself, for fun, to compete or simply to make friends. <strong>You are
not the game you play. Your self-worth is not determined by the game you
play.</strong> Ask yourself, ‘What do you really want from the game?’.</li>
<li>Give up the attachment with your game with respect to motives and ultimate
targets. Enjoy the game.</li>
<li>Competition is about making yourself better. Competition is about having
a challenging opponent who brings out the best in you. Embrace competition
as a natural process of learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the book. It does feel repetitive at times but given
that it’s a short book (~130 pages), I strongly recommend it.</p>
