<h2>Overview of BOSC and ISMB, 2016</h2>
<p class=subtitle> Impressions of my first conference attendance </p>
</header>
<p>This year I attended the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) from
July 8-12 in Orlando, Florida. But before I talk about my experience of the
conference (and amazing Disney World!), let me roll back a bit and tell you
about why I was there.

<h3 id=iscb-competition>ISCB competition&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#iscb-competition></a> </h3>
<p>Several months ago, I wrote a <a href=/science/wikiproject-submission><em>short</em></a> describing my submission for ISCB
Wikipedia article writing competition. For those who don’t know, the competition
invited people to improve upon existing computational biology articles on
Wikipedia by adding or improving upon existing resources. The simple
aim of the initiative was to propagate the idea of open-science and
open-research, and to encourage collective community efforts for knowlege
curation.</p>
<p>So, after the official editing period finished in January, I got busy in other
college activities and nearly forgot about it until one day in June when
I received an email from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bateman>Alex
Bateman</a>. He let me know, much to my
suprise and joy, that my contributions were judged in top 3 by the review
committee; and if I would like to come to ISMB 2016 and receive the award
in person. He also generously agreed to partially sponsor my travel
and accommodation for the conference. Lucky for me that I was in Seattle the very same
summer!</p>
<p>Few weeks later, I am walking through the hallways of the conference venue and decks of
the wonderful Disney World resort, marveling at the sheer scale of the conference with
thousands of people from all over the world and in all-ranks enthusiastically swarming
around conference halls and ball rooms for poster sessions, talks, and getting to see
their colleagues and collaborators.</p>
<h3 id=bosc-ismb-and-dinner>BOSC, ISMB, and Dinner!&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#bosc-ismb-and-dinner></a> </h3>
<p>Since I went a day before the main conference was scheduled to start, I could
attend a half day session of
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust>BOSC</a>, a special interest group
meeting, organized two days before ISMB. Bastian Greshake, founder of OpenSNP
and also my mentor for Google Summer of Code project, gave a talk about latest
developments with the project. It was a fun experience to see my name feature
twice on presentations as a Google Summer of Code student for OBF and OpenSNP.
In the evening, I joined about 20 other people including <a href=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/>Peter
Cock</a> (lead
developer of BioPython), <a href=https://github.com/sjackman>Shaun Jackman</a> (developer
of LinuxBrew), <a href=http://ruleofthirds.de/>Bastian Greshake</a> (founder of
OpenSNP.org), and <a href=http://www2.lbl.gov/msd/people/investigators.html>Nomi
Harris</a> (co-chair of BOSC
‘17) for dinner in Orlando city.</p>
<p>The main ISMB conference started from next day. It was, however, a struggle to wake up at
9 am in the morning while I was still jetlagged. I missed the morning keynotes for two
consecutive days. Additionally, it was difficult to decide which talks to attend since
I neither had any speaker preference nor I knew any of them. I followed the talk
descriptions and went to the ones I liked – mostly related to challenges of big-data and
machine learning in biology.</p>
<p>Later that day, I met with Alex Bateman and we discussed about organizing the
Wikipedia editathon the next day. He also introduced me to Alastair K.,
a post-doctoral student at UCSD and also one of the former winners of the ISCB
competition.

<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t explore much of area around Disney resort the previous day,
I used the rest of my evening to enjoy the atmosphere and explore dinner
options. Finding food, however, turned out to be a struggle. Unless you can
live on french fries and coke, or are ready to burn holes in your wallet (not
a problem if your expenses are reimbursed), moving around and relying on Disney
World eateries is best to be avoided. Guess which one I did?</p>
<p>Next morning, I met with Alex and Alastair again. We reviewed the wiki presentation and
a general workflow of the editathon to be organized later that evening. During
the poster session, Alex Bateman also introduced me to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Teichmann>Sarah
Teichmann</a>, Head of Cellular
Genetics at the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust>Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute</a>, one of
the keynote speakers of the conference. For the rest of the day, I moved around
the venue skimming posters and listening to the presentors. It was quite
a coincidence when I run into Johannes Koster, one of the lead contributors to
Bioconda project. He was quick to recognize my name since I had contributed
couple <em>recipes</em> to the project. It&rsquo;s surprising how small the world can be
sometimes. There were also a couple of funny instances when people mistook me
for a graduate student, but I realize that is a safe question to ask since there
were many graduate students at the conference.</p>
<p><strong>ISMB Wikipedia Editathon 2016</strong></p>
<p>After the poster session was over, we conducted the editathon as planned. Alex
led the editing session with a few demonstrations done by Alastair, while I was
available as an assistant if someone faced any issues. We attracted a moderate
crowd (~20 people) of interesting people. The important takeaway lessons from
the workshop are documented <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/ISMB_2016_Editathon>here</a>.</p>
<p>However, by the end of the day, the immense excitement of people around me and
the buzz of science overwhelmed me. I felt like I am missing something.</p>
<p>Later that night, I spent some time walking around the beautiful decks arching over the
lakes in the resort area ruminating over the thought I had earlier. Rain showers earlier
in the day had cooled the weather to a pleasant and enjoyable levels. Occasional fireworks
broke the silence of the sky and decorated everything with bright colors for a split
second. People dressed in various cartoon characters occupied the deck and entertained
kids with their tricks and animated performances. Adults too were amused once in a while
and seemed to be relive their childhood.</p>
<p>It was in those moments that my thoughts became clearer to me. I was not sad, scared or
intimidated because of the scale of the conference and science involved. I was sad because
I too wanted to be a part of that community. The event triggered a deep seated longing in
my heart, the satisfaction of working on your passion and proudly presenting it to the
world—for all the accolades and criticism it has to offer. I felt a deep sense of
understanding as I walked back to my room to get some sleep and prepare for the final day
of the conference.</p>
<p>Next day, also the final day of the conference, I hopped through some sponsor
exhibits and collected a few t-shirts and goodies. Finally, my excitement
surged to its peak when the awards ceremony began as the culminating element of
the conference.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great experience—made possible only due to generous efforts of
Alex Bateman, and Gustavo Glusman, my mentor at Institute for Systems Biology.
I made several friends, met influential people, and above all, took a closer
look at the cutting-edge research research of the field.</p>
<p>See you at ISMB/ECCB 2017 conference in Prague next year!</p>
