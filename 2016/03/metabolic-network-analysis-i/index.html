<h2>Metabolic Network Analysis - I</h2>
<p class=subtitle> The Beginners’ guide </p>
</header>
<p>In this short tutorial, we will explore the basic steps of a metabolic network
analysis.</p>
<p>For our convenience, we will avoid using full models or discuss their
reconstruction methods, instead focus on simple reactions to create
a theoretical background. However, the steps can be scaled without any loss of
generality. The related exercises should help build a theoretical background
along with necessary programming skills.<br>

<h3 id=introduction>Introduction&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#introduction></a> </h3>
<h4 id=what-is-a-metabolic-network>What is a metabolic network?&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#what-is-a-metabolic-network></a> </h4>
<p>A metabolic network is just a collection of <em>nodes</em> and <em>edges</em> used to
represent the relationship between different cellular components. These
components could be genes, enzymes, reactions, metabolites or other factors.
The nodes store data while edges relate them according to a specific nature of
relationship. For example, think of a social network where people are nodes and edges
store the friendship information.</p>
<p>A metabolic network, thus, must represent the metabolic process using nodes and
edges.</p>
<h4 id=storing-the-data>Storing the data&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#storing-the-data></a> </h4>
<p>Thousands of chemical reactions occur at a time, even in relatively simpler
organisms like <em>E.coli</em>. A popular and computationally amenable way to store
this information is in the form of a matrix, called a <a href="http://www.bio-physics.at/wiki/index.php?title=Stoichiometric_Matrix"><strong>stoichiometry
matrix</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A stoichiometry matrix records the relationship between different metabolites and
the particular chemical reactions they participate in. If you are familiar with
networks already, it is similar to an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix>adjacency matrix</a> representation.</p>
<h4 id=example>Example&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#example></a> </h4>
<p>Consider the following sample of chemical reactions take from <em>E.coli</em> BL21(DE3)
strain, a popularly used <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_%28biotechnology%29>expression host</a>.</p>
<p>$$ ade_c + prpp_c → amp_c + ppi_c \tag{1} $$
$$ 3amac_c + h_c + h2o_c → msa_c + nh4_c \tag{2} $$
$$ accoa_c + h2o_c + oaa_c → cit_c + coa_c + h_c \tag{3} $$</p>
<p><span class=hint>Hint: Confused about symbols? See <a href=http://bigg.ucsd.edu/models/iECD_1391/reactions/ADPT>1</a>, <a href=http://bigg.ucsd.edu/models/iECD_1391/reactions/3AMACHYD>2</a>, <a href=http://bigg.ucsd.edu/models/iECD_1391/reactions/CS>3</a> </span></p>
<p>A complete set of reactions along with list of metabolites and genes for
a particular organism can be obtained from online databases like
<a href=http://bigg.ucsd.edu/>BiGG</a>, <a href=https://kegg.jp>KEGG</a>.</p>
<p>The dataset can be obtained in several file formats like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>JSON</a>,
<a href=http://sbml.org>SBML</a>, or <a href=http://www.mathworks.com/help/pdf_doc/matlab/matfile_format.pdf>MAT</a> depending on application used for further analysis. We’ll
come back to this later.</p>
<h3 id=network-construction>Network construction&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#network-construction></a> </h3>
<h4 id=creating-stoichiometry-matrix>Creating stoichiometry matrix&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#creating-stoichiometry-matrix></a> </h4>
<p>To construct a stoichiometry matrix, we need to have the following information
(both of which are present in model file):</p>
<ul>
<li>Participating metabolites \(( \vec{m} )\)</li>
<li>(Balanced) Chemical reactions \(( \vec{R} )\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Following from previous example, we can see that \( \vec{m} \) is
a vector of size \( m = 13 \) (unique metabolites) and \( \vec{R} \) is of
size \( n = 3 \). The resulting stoichiometry matrix \(( S )\) is of size \(
m \times n \), where each row represents a metabolite and each column represents
a reaction. Each cell \((c_{ij})\) populated using a simple rule — \(a\) if
a metabolite is produced in that reaction, \(- a\) if consumed, 0 otherwise;
where \(a\) is the stoichiometry coefficient of the metabolite.</p>
<p>For example, a stoichiometry for reaction \( (1) \) will be:</p>
<p>$$
\mathbf{S} =
\left(
\begin{array}{c|c}
ade_c & -1\\ prpp_c & -1\\ amp_c & 1\\ ppi_c & 1 \\
\end{array}\right)
$$</p>
<span class=hint>
Exercise: Try writing S matrix for all three reactions.<br>
Exercise: Write a (Python?) script to create S matrix from a <a href=https://gist.github.com/vivekiitkgp/6474b821b96dfdb9b21a>list</a> of reactions. <br>
Exercise: Write a program to find all the reactions in which a given metabolite participates.
</span>
<h4 id=other-matrices>Other matrices&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#other-matrices></a> </h4>
<p>Similarly, you can create different matrices containing other kind of reaction
information. For example, elemental matrix (\( \vec{E} \)), charge-balance
matrix, moiety matrix, flux matrix (\( \vec{v} \)).</p>
<p>These matrices combined with a stoichiometry matrix yield necessary information
about a reaction, like atoms and charged species involved, rate of concentration
changes etc.</p>
<p>The advantage of using matrices is that conservation principles can be verified
through a simple matrix multiplication.</p>
<h3 id=visualizing-the-network>Visualizing the network&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#visualizing-the-network></a> </h3>
<p>Once the metabolic network model grows beyond a few reactions and metabolites,
it becomes increasingly difficult to visualize the relationship between the
components. Visualization allows us to observe key network structures, critical
pathways and important metabolites without much analysis.</p>
<h4 id=reaction-and-compound-maps>Reaction and compound maps&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#reaction-and-compound-maps></a> </h4>
<p>A common strategy is to visualize the content of stoichiometry matrix in two
ways - a <em>reaction map</em> and <em>metabolite map</em>.</p>
<p>A reaction map is drawn with metabolites as nodes and reactions as edges. The
edges link the metabolite nodes which are consumed in the reaction to the
metabolite nodes which are produced in the reaction. The nature of
(ir)reversible nature of reaction can be indicated by the direction of the link.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a compound map consists of reactions as nodes and metabolites
as edges. In a similar manner, edges link the reaction nodes where a metabolite
is produced to the reaction where it is consumed.</p>
<p>Both of these representations draw attention to different aspects of the same
metabolic network. For example, the reaction map allows us to visualize
the most important metabolites of the network while the metabolite map allows us
to distinguish the core reactions.</p>
<span class=hint>
Exercise: Write the compound map for the S matrix of above three reactions.<br>
Exercise: Write a program to generate reaction and compound map graphs in
memory.
</span>
<h4 id=other-tools>Other tools&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#other-tools></a> </h4>
<p>Some common ways to visualize a network is to use a tool like
<a href=http://www.cytoscape.org/>Cytospace</a> or <a href=http://visant.bu.edu/>visANT</a>.</p>
<span class=hint>
Exercise: Draw the graphs using a visualization library in your language of
choice (networkx in Python).
</span>
<h3 id=further>Further&nbsp;<a class=anchor href=#further></a> </h3>
<p>A lot remains to be discussed. In the next tutorial of this series, we’ll look
closely at stoichiometry matrix, use complete models, derive useful properties,
and learn ways to simulate the model. Towards the end, I hope that a small
case-study will serve as a comprehensive example to assimilate all the
information.</p>
<p>In the meantime, feel free to experiment with the exercises and send in your
suggestions.</p>
