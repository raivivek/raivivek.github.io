<span class=sidenote>‘Language in Thought and Action’ by <em>S.I. Hayakawa</em>.</span></span></p><p>From the moment you wake up in the morning till the moment you go to bed, you
are exposed to constant sources of information. Whether it’s your morning
newspaper, your boss, a group of friends that you hang out with, or the
multitude of feed applications on your smartphone; your brain is being flooded
by a Niagara of words.

<span class=sidenote>&ldquo;[&mldr;] by 2015, the sum of media asked for and delivered to consumers on
mobile devices and to their homes would take more than 15 hours a day to see
or hear. That volume is equal to 6.9 million-million gigabytes of
information, or a daily consumption of nine DVDs worth of data per person per
day.&rdquo; <a href=http://www.marshall.usc.edu/faculty/centers/ctm/research/how-much-media><em>How Much Media? 2015, Report on American Consumers</em></a>"</span>
</span>Each of these sources has the power to shape
your thoughts and inevitably your actions by carefully

content. Like it or not, every day you draw new inferences from things you hear
about people you may or may not know and create subtle judgments in your mind.</p><a class=read-more href=https://raivivek.in/2016/03/writing-my-journal-of-tils/>Read more →</a></p></section><section><header><h2><a href=https://raivivek.in/2016/02/how-to-give-a-good-talk/>How to Give a Good Talk</a></h2><p><time datetime=2016-02-01T00:00:00Z>Mon Feb 1, 2016 by Vivek Rai</time></p></header><p><p>There are many more ways to get a presentation wrong than there are to get it

before our temporal abilities are decently developed (usually by the end of
third month after birth), people sing songs, lullabies, read stories or make
interesting noises to stimulate our brain. Not much later, reading becomes
out favorite activity where we have already irritated our parents to read
<em>Winnie-the-Pooh</em> over and again for umpteenth time. This habit, however,
grows only up to the teenage years and then starts to diminish, only to
increase again later in
life.<a href=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED496343.pdf>1</a></p><a class=read-more href=https://raivivek.in/2015/04/the-importance-of-reading/>Read more →</a></p></section></article><div class=footer><div class=footer-content><div><ul></ul><a href=# class="pure-menu-link pull-right" id=gototop-btn>↑↑</a></div></div></div></body></html>
