different aspects of learning (or acquiring) a new skill. He argues that key to
acquiring any new skill requires contribution from two distinct entities in your
brain, which he calls <em>Self-1</em> and <em>Self-2</em>. Tennis is simply an example author
uses to put forward his ideas and provide demonstration. More so, because he had
been a tennis coach and a good player himself. The two <em>selves</em> can loosely be
equated to <em>System 1</em> and <em>System 2</em> discussed by Daniel Kahneman in his famous
book <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow><em>Thinking Fast and
Slow</em></a>. I strongly
recommend the latter if you haven’t read it yet.</p><a class=read-more href=https://raivivek.in/2016/review-the-inner-game-of-tennis/>Read more →</a></p></section><section><header><h2><a href=https://raivivek.in/2016/review-burmese-days/>Review: Burmese Days</a></h2><p><time datetime=2016-02-18T00:00:00Z>Thu Feb 18, 2016 by Vivek Rai</time></p></header><p><div class=epigraph><blockquote><p>It is one of the tragedies of the half-educated that they develop late, when they are already committed to some wrong way of life.</p><footer>George Orwell,

Schrödinger</a>, an eminent
physicist and Nobel Prize winner, the book <strong>What is Life?</strong> (<a href=http://whatislife.stanford.edu/LoCo_files/What-is-Life.pdf>get
here</a>) is an attempt
to understand the aspects of life as manifested by living organisms. As
philosophical it may sound, the author instead endeavors to understand the
organization and behavior of <em>life</em> &ndash; from individual cells to higher organism,
from the point of a physicist. The book is appealing even to lay readers and
builds on important conceptual constructs of physics without delving too much
into mathematical formulations.</p><a class=read-more href=https://raivivek.in/2015/review-what-is-life/>Read more →</a></p></section></article><div class=footer><div class=footer-content><div><ul></ul><a href=# class="pure-menu-link pull-right" id=gototop-btn>↑↑</a></div></div></div></body></html>
