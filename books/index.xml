different aspects of learning (or acquiring) a new skill. He argues that key to
acquiring any new skill requires contribution from two distinct entities in your
brain, which he calls &lt;em>Self-1&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Self-2&lt;/em>. Tennis is simply an example author
uses to put forward his ideas and provide demonstration. More so, because he had
been a tennis coach and a good player himself. The two &lt;em>selves&lt;/em> can loosely be
equated to &lt;em>System 1&lt;/em> and &lt;em>System 2&lt;/em> discussed by Daniel Kahneman in his famous
book &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">&lt;em>Thinking Fast and
Slow&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. I strongly
recommend the latter if you haven’t read it yet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review: Burmese Days</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2016/review-burmese-days/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2016/review-burmese-days/</guid><description>&lt;div class="epigraph">

It is one of the tragedies of the half-educated that they develop late, when they are already committed to some wrong way of life.

If a man never contradicts himself, the reason must be that he virtually
never says anything at all.

&lt;p>Written by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin
Schrödinger&lt;/a>, an eminent
physicist and Nobel Prize winner, the book &lt;strong>What is Life?&lt;/strong> (&lt;a href="http://whatislife.stanford.edu/LoCo_files/What-is-Life.pdf">get
here&lt;/a>) is an attempt
to understand the aspects of life as manifested by living organisms. As
philosophical it may sound, the author instead endeavors to understand the
organization and behavior of &lt;em>life&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; from individual cells to higher organism,
from the point of a physicist. The book is appealing even to lay readers and
builds on important conceptual constructs of physics without delving too much
into mathematical formulations.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
