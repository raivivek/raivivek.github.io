During my research internship at Indian Institute of Science, I had the
opportunity to attend several lecture series by eminent professors, who
introduced us to different fields (e.g., Biomechanics, Systems Biology) and
relevant research they have done in their careers. While all of the lectures
were insightful, one which caught my most attention were those delivered
Dr. Aditya Murthy on neuroscience. His amazing presentation skills, sense of
humor and rigor left me in awe!</p><a class=read-more href=https://raivivek.in/2015/09/a-challenging-course-catalog/>Read more →</a></p></section><section><header><h2><a href=https://raivivek.in/2015/08/protein-knotscolon-a-tangled-story/>Protein Knots: A tangled story</a></h2><p><time datetime=2015-08-22T00:00:00Z>Sat Aug 22, 2015 by Vivek Rai</time></p></header><p><p>Journal Club is a weekly paper presentation session organized in our department
