 &lt;p> The &lt;em>intersection&lt;/em> is the best place to innovate. These innovations change the
world in leaps along new directions by opening up new fields, creating new
information and allowing creators to become leaders. This intersection is the
place where wildly different ideas from various areas bump into each other
and build upon each other. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overview of BOSC and ISMB, 2016</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2016/09/overview-of-bosc-and-ismb-2016/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2016/09/overview-of-bosc-and-ismb-2016/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year I attended the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) from
July 8-12 in Orlando, Florida. But before I talk about my experience of the
conference (and amazing Disney World!), let me roll back a bit and tell you
about why I was there.

analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For our convenience, we will avoid using full models or discuss their
reconstruction methods, instead focus on simple reactions to create
a theoretical background. However, the steps can be scaled without any loss of
generality. The related exercises should help build a theoretical background
along with necessary programming skills.&lt;br>

because it&amp;rsquo;s turning about to be pretty challenging and full of new
information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Prologue:&lt;/strong>
During my research internship at Indian Institute of Science, I had the
opportunity to attend several lecture series by eminent professors, who
introduced us to different fields (e.g., Biomechanics, Systems Biology) and
relevant research they have done in their careers. While all of the lectures
were insightful, one which caught my most attention were those delivered
Dr. Aditya Murthy on neuroscience. His amazing presentation skills, sense of
humor and rigor left me in awe!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Protein Knots&amp;colon; A tangled story</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2015/08/protein-knotscolon-a-tangled-story/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2015/08/protein-knotscolon-a-tangled-story/</guid><description>&lt;p>Journal Club is a weekly paper presentation session organized in our department
by us, where one could present an remarkable research finding,
discuss a new experimental technique or simply introduce everyone to a new or
less explored field in the area of biology. I have mentioned about this
initiative in my earlier posts, and it is something that I really feel excited
to talk about. The audience size is pretty decent (around 15-20 people)
consisting of professors, research scholar, graduates and undergraduate
students.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Working with pore forming toxin - II</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2015/07/working-with-pore-forming-toxin-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2015/07/working-with-pore-forming-toxin-ii/</guid><description>&lt;div class="epigraph">

&lt;p>This chinese proverb accurately describes my summer experience at the Indian

eight long weeks (May 11 - July 10).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Working with pore forming toxin - I</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2015/05/working-with-pore-forming-toxin-i/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2015/05/working-with-pore-forming-toxin-i/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>Douglas Adams, &lt;em>The Salmon of Doubt&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Douglas Adam was correct about Experience. It is a harsh teacher. The fact that
words like &amp;ldquo;struggle&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;fail fast&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t give up&amp;rdquo; are commonly used to describe some of
its lessons, speaks about the inherent difficulty of the whole process &amp;mdash; and none
of it more visible anywhere than when learning something new.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>research needs funding</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2015/04/research-needs-funding/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2015/04/research-needs-funding/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/Brian-Farley-3">Brian Farley&lt;/a> writes ..&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve said this before on Quora, and I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to say it many more
times, but, all of the problems in academia can be traced back to &lt;strong>scarce
funding and the ridiculous competition it engenders&lt;/strong>. The reluctance to fund
academia and research, in turn, comes from a completely skewed perception by
the public of what academia is supposed to accomplish &amp;ndash; which in no small part
comes from the capitalist marketplace thinking that permeates almost everything
our society does.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Papers per week</title><link>https://raivivek.in/2015/04/papers-per-week/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raivivek.in/2015/04/papers-per-week/</guid><description>&lt;div class="epigraph">

&lt;p>Reading research papers, literature survey as one may call it, is one of the
primary tasks of any research enthusiast, student, academician, or researcher.
As we advance through our academic career, the complexity and quantity of
content keeps increasing until the text books give up. The inflow of
information is too rapid and too vast to be contained and sufficiency conveyed
to the target audience, thus necessitating the need of specialized sources.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
